# Stuff I remember for some reason

* ████ (before the age of 10) saying "I can keep talking if I don't stop to think!"
* that poster in my room of all the ████ of ████
* ████ — first guy crush
* The cave interior in Greedy Zebra (Hadithi, Kennaway)
* The 9 Tasks of Mistry (McEwan), and in particular the Cage of Illusion (bit heavy-handed for that to stick in my memory but hey sometimes you get a freebie)
* The Fallen Spaceman (Harding)
