## The Power of Conditioning

Our Type, Strategy and Inner Authority are reflective of how to be in alignment with our nature, but conditioning often gets in the way of this.

In your BodyGraph there are “open” areas—everything white or not colored in. Each open area is a receptor to conditioning, a doorway for conditioning to enter and keep you from expressing your authentic self. This process starts early on within our family dynamics, and continues throughout life as we are exposed to the various influences of the outside world. The conditioning we experience can be overwhelming, distort our perspective, and influence how we make decisions.

However, once we are aware of this dynamic, we can use our openness in specific areas to gain wisdom in life, rather than identifying with the energetic frequencies that are not part of who we are.

## Root Center

Themes: Physical Adrenalized Pressure, Drive, Stress

Not-Self Theme: Always in a hurry to be free of the pressure.

Not-Self Question: Am I in a hurry to get things done so I can be free of pressure?

### Not-Self Talk

Open Centers create their own decision-making strategies in an attempt to keep us safe from confusion and pain. However, over time, these strategies become unhealthy, leading us to live a life of Not-Self actions. In other words, a life that is not our own.

Not-Self talk reveals your open Centers in action; noticing this talk is essential to deconditioning, as you can finally be aware of whether your actions are being dictated by your True-Self or Not-Self.

Notice your mind and what it is saying or telling you about your life. Notice how the mind will continually try to make your decisions.

#### **Not-Self Talk of the Open Root Center:**

* I’d better hurry up and get this done
* I have to start something new now
* How can I get past this limitation?
* I need something to focus on

### Analysis

You have an open Root Center, meaning you naturally amplify pressure and stress. The trick is not to let it determine your actions. Rushing through everything in a hurry to be free of the pressure is the general theme of having an open Root, but it’s not the way to live.

**It is not natural for you to be in a hurry—don't allow yourself to be pressured into making hasty decisions.** When you are with others there is a tendency to go hyper or get carried away by the rush; however, running off others’ stress and adrenaline can lead to an overload of pressure, leaving you exhausted and burnt out. You need to give yourself more time and room to discharge and unwind. Don't judge yourself for being lazy; instead, realize that your body needs rest.

Enjoy the rush and adrenaline of stress, but deal with it without becoming overwhelmed by it. Don't succumb to pressure to do things more quickly. This will only result in a never-ending cycle of actions you think need to be done to be free. The more you are pressured, the less you should respond. Learn to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy environmental pressure, and give yourself time to complete the tasks you committed to.

### Healthy vs Unhealthy

There are healthy and unhealthy traits related to having an open Root Center.

#### **Healthy Traits:**

* Not letting others' stress and pressure determine actions

* Never allowing yourself to be pressured or hurried into making a decision
* Enjoying the rush and adrenaline of stress and dealing with the pressure without letting it overwhelm you
* Refusing to succumb to pressure to do things more quickly
* Knowing the more you are pressured, the less you respond

* Rushing through everything

* Allowing insufficient time and space to discharge and unwind

## Sacral Center

Themes: Vital Energy, Respondability, Availability, Sexuality, Fertility

Not-Self Theme: Not knowing when enough is enough.

Not-Self Question: Do I know when enough is enough?

### Not-Self Talk

Open Centers create their own decision-making strategies in an attempt to keep us safe from confusion and pain. However, over time, these strategies become unhealthy, leading us to live a life of Not-Self actions. In other words, a life that is not our own.

Not-Self talk reveals your open Centers in action; noticing this talk is essential to deconditioning, as you can finally be aware of whether your actions are being dictated by your True-Self or Not-Self.

Notice your mind and what it is saying or telling you about your life. Notice how the mind will continually try to make your decisions.

#### **Not-Self Talk of the Open Sacral Center:**

* Let’s keep working
* We really need to get this done
* We need to say yes to that, otherwise we might miss out on something
* I can keep going
* We can do that, too. Not a problem.
* I have to do it myself

### Analysis

You have an open Sacral Center, which at its core means you are very open energetically. **The most important thing for you to discover is when enough is enough.** You are very susceptible to becoming a conditioned worker, overworking and burning out. Those in your life with defined Sacral Centers, roughly 70% of humanity, have a powerful impact on how you feel energetically. This energy you take in influences your actions, and can lead to taking on too much, over-committing and at times feeling unable to say no. If you do commit while under this influence, once you find yourself alone and away from the energy, you may realize you cannot deal with the workload, losing confidence and leading to exhaustion.

In fact, you are not meant to be a tireless worker. Your body is not equipped to handle and sustain elevated levels of energy. In the long run, this will only overwhelm and exhaust you. You can enjoy the buzz of those with defined Sacrals, letting it vitalize and flow through you, but always ready to withdraw and discharge when your body needs rest. **In essence, you can learn to be wise about how the life force energy works.** Instead of feeling pressured to do things or get things done, recognize you are able to step back, and take the time to rest when needed.

The Sacral Center is also the source of sexuality. Instead of repressing your sexuality or identifying with others’ sexual conditioning, which can lead to neediness and confusion, enjoy your openness without identifying with any particular role. The open Sacral can teach you to be discerning about engaging in sexual intimacy, and to learn about safe boundaries.

### Healthy vs Unhealthy

These are the healthy and unhealthy traits related to having an open Sacral Center.

#### **Healthy Traits:**

* Being wise about life and the life force
* Knowing when enough is enough, knowing when to stop and when to rest
* Being able to surrender to the buzz of the generator world without getting involved in it
* Allowing others to vitalize you, letting life flow through you, knowing when to withdraw and discharge
* Being able to step back and allow others do their share of the work
* Enjoying the diversity of sexual roles without identifying with any particular one

#### **Unhealthy Traits:**

* Being conditioned to be a worker, overcommitting, overworking, burning out
* Not knowing when enough is enough
* Trying to take on too much and overcommitting, being unable to say no, especially when influenced by others
* Putting yourself under great pressure to work, frequently becoming overwhelmed and exhausted by other people’s energy
* Being away from that energy you cannot deal with the workload, losing confidence and eventually crashing
* Repressing sexuality or identifying with sexual conditioning from others, leading to neediness and confusion

## Splenic Center

Themes: Basic/Survival Fears, Well-Being, Immune System, Intuition, Instincts

Not-Self Theme: Holding on to what isn’t good for you.

Not-Self Question: Am I holding on to what isn’t good for me?

### Not-Self Talk

Open Centers create their own decision-making strategies in an attempt to keep us safe from confusion and pain. However, over time, these strategies become unhealthy, leading us to live a life of Not-Self actions. In other words, a life that is not our own.

Not-Self talk reveals your open Centers in action; noticing this talk is essential to deconditioning, as you can finally be aware of whether your actions are being dictated by your True-Self or Not-Self.

Notice your mind and what it is saying or telling you about your life. Notice how the mind will continually try to make your decisions.

#### **Not-Self Talk of the Open Splenic Center:**

* Let's not do that, because it makes me insecure&#x20;
* I'm afraid that I will feel inadequate if I do that
* I'm not going to do that, because I might fail
* I'm afraid of doing that, because I’m afraid of what the future will bring
* I'm afraid of doing that, because I'm afraid of the responsibility or the criticism
* I can’t do that, because I might lose my connection with that person

### Analysis

You have an open Splenic Center, meaning your physical wellbeing and general sense of feeling good is inconsistent and susceptible to others’ conditioning. This inconsistency is what makes you sensitive and highly attuned to your body’s needs, as well as others’ needs. Among your gifts is the natural ability to diagnose the physical wellbeing of others. You are open to how someone feels and can naturally assess a person’s or even a place’s health.

However, as you are open to another’s wellbeing, or lack thereof, you take in that conditioning and amplify it. This is where you must be careful to **choose people and things that are healthy for you, and most importantly, be strong enough to let go of things that are not.** By holding on to what isn't good for you out of fear and a need to feel safe and secure, you are harming yourself. There may be many people in your life who make you feel good, but it is vital not to become dependent on anyone or anything, and to let go when necessary for your own sake.

The Splenic Center holds primal fears for our survival and wellbeing, and each Gate represents a primary fear for survival. With an undefined Spleen, these fears are easily magnified; you may therefore tend to hold on to those things and people that help to dissipate these fears, irrespective of whether this is ultimately beneficial for you. It is important that you tackle and handle these fears to cultivate your own sense of security, build physical resilience and avoid becoming dependent on others or potentially overwhelmed by fears.

Constantly chasing that “feel-good,” and trying to address inconsistencies through diet, therapy, relationships or helping others will not fix anything in the long run. Remember, you experience inconsistency and always will. When you are in the aura of someone with a defined Spleen you may feel pressured to act spontaneously in the hope of feeling better, or making the fear go away. While it is correct for a defined Spleen to be spontaneous, this is generally not true for open Spleens who lack reliable or consistent intuition to guide you in the moment. **As a general rule, acting spontaneously with an open Spleen potentially jeopardizes your safety and wellbeing.** Simply put, do not sacrifice your own security for the sake of feeling good.&#x20;

## Healthy vs Unhealthy

These are the healthy and unhealthy traits related to having an open Splenic Center.

#### **Healthy Traits:**

* Gaining wisdom about health and wellbeing, choosing people and things that are healthy, able to let go of what is not serving you at the right time
* Accepting the inconsistency of physical wellbeing, knowing that it is what makes you sensitive and highly attuned to the body's needs
* Being adept at sensing unhealthy vibrations in others or the environment
* Learning to be wise about the nature of fear by not reacting to it or trying to fix it
* Enjoying others’ aura without becoming dependent

#### **Unhealthy Traits:**

* Holding on to what isn't good for you out of fear and a need to feel safe and secure
* Constantly chasing after feeling good and trying to fix the inconsistency through diet, therapy, relationships or helping others
* Getting caught up in how it feels, physically "becoming your own problem”
* Trying to be spontaneous to feel better and make the fear go away
* Sacrificing security for the sake of wellbeing
* Becoming dependent in relationships

## Ajna Center

Themes: Mental process, Concepts, Ideas, Opinions, Insights, Answers

Not-Self Theme: Pretending to be certain.

Not-Self Question: Am I trying to convince everyone that I am certain?

### Not-Self Talk

Open Centers create their own decision-making strategies in an attempt to keep us safe from confusion and pain. However, over time, these strategies become unhealthy, leading us to live a life of Not-Self actions. In other words, a life that is not our own.

Not-Self talk reveals your open Centers in action; noticing this talk is essential to deconditioning, as you can finally be aware of whether your actions are being dictated by your True-Self or Not-Self.

Notice your mind and what it is saying or telling you about your life. Notice how the mind will continually try to make your decisions.

#### **Not-Self Talk of the Open Ajna Center:**

* We have to figure this out
* What should I do with my life? I've got to figure out what to do with my life.
* Where is my next move?
* I am certain that ...&#x20;
* I have to 'know' the answer
* I have to put order to my life to get rid of the chaos
* I have to make this new idea a reality in my life
* I'm not going to share my opinion, because I don't want to be challenged

### Analysis

You have an open Ajna Center, meaning the way you process information and conceptualize is not fixed. **Your gift is the potential wisdom of being open minded without the need for certainty.** You should be ok with saying “I don't know” and being open to what others have to say. You will find there is a lot to learn, and that you truly do not know everything. How many times have you said, “Yes, I’m certain this is the way it is,” only to realize a couple of days later you’re actually doubting what you said?

**It’s healthy for you to have a fluid and adaptable way of thinking, soaking up all kinds of data, without identifying with any of it or claiming it as your own truth.** The undefined mind is not designed to be consistent but ranges from being completely empty to overflowing with ideas, concepts and opinions. Having no fixed way of processing thoughts will only enhance your intelligence, something you will then be able to share with others. In fact, the very fluid nature of the undefined mind is the source of its dynamic and ever-changing intelligence, and open minds can be extremely creative and intellectual. &#x20;

As it is not easy to retain a consistent thought process when on your own, people with undefined Ajnas tend either to devalue their mind or try too hard to be intellectual. Those in your life with fixed minds will think and speak in a certain way, which does not mean one is better or worse; there is simply uniqueness. **You do not need to worry about not understanding and remembering things, or to compare yourself intellectually to others.** Your open mind allows you take in what others are processing mentally, and you can store huge amounts of information, even though you may not have conscious access to what is stored in your memory but wait for it to be triggered or cued. Your gift is the ability to learn from all mental processes, not be fixed in any one way, and to discern which concepts, ideas or insights are of value.&#x20;

Your natural state is to remain open, not to identify with concepts and beliefs you have acquired along the way. Take advantage of your openness, and appreciate your very dynamic mind, which is a superb processor of information, capable of deep contemplation and acquiring much wisdom about the ways of the world.

### Healthy vs Unhealthy

These are the healthy and unhealthy traits related to having an open Ajna Center.

#### **Healthy Traits:**

* Realizing there is no need to be certain
* Being ok with saying "I don't know" and being open minded
* Having a fluid and adaptable way of thinking, able to soak up new ideas and concepts, without becoming fixed on any of them
* Enjoying having no fixed way of processing information and the openness and versatility of intelligence

#### **Unhealthy Traits:**

* Tending to worry about not understanding and remembering things
* Trying too hard to be intellectual, holding on to fixed mental processes, concepts or opinions
* Pretending you are certain, yet feeling mentally insecure and therefore trying hard to seem sure about things

## Head Center

Themes: Inspiration, Mental Pressure, Doubt, Confusion, and Questions

Not-Self Theme: Thinking about things that don't matter.

Not-Self Question: Am I trying to answer everybody else’s questions?

### Not-Self Talk

Open Centers create their own decision-making strategies in an attempt to keep us safe from confusion and pain. However, over time, these strategies become unhealthy, leading us to live a life of Not-Self actions. In other words, a life that is not our own.

Not-Self talk reveals your open Centers in action; noticing this talk is essential to deconditioning, as you can finally be aware of whether your actions are being dictated by your True-Self or Not-Self.

Notice your mind and what it is saying or telling you about your life. Notice how the mind will continually try to make your decisions.&#x20;

#### **Not-Self Talk of the Open Head Center:**

* I need to find something inspiring
* I need to find an answer to my questions
* Where can I go to find the answers?
* I've got to understand this and/or make sense of this
* Who can I talk to, to find the answers?

### Analysis

You have an open (undefined) Head Center, meaning you are open to new insights, questions, and those mental sparks that “fill” you with inspiration. The open Head Center also has tremendous potential to provide inspiration that can lead to wisdom. However, if you’re too busy questioning and thinking about things that don't matter or have nothing to do with you, then this potential wisdom is being subdued.

At any time, or with anyone, you can easily become lost or overwhelmed by doubt and confusion that actually concerns others. This pressure results in questions, which you end up trying to resolve. The key is in understanding that they are not your questions and it’s probably not worth spending time and energy on finding the answers. **It’s very common for people with open Head centers to take on the pressure of other people’s need for answers.** However, this simply isn’t healthy; you are not designed to be constricted to any one person's mental process. The potential in your openness is to understand the various thought processes and turn this into wisdom, not be stuck in any one way of thinking.

To have a healthy open Head center is to be open to inspiration and questions from anywhere and anyone. At the same time, realize who the questions belong to without spending your time and energy on them, or feeling compelled to resolve them. **Letting go of this pressure of other people’s need for answers results in relaxation, allowing you to enjoy new insights, mental sparks, and inspiration.** With an open Head center, you are likely to explore a wide range of stimulating intellectual and also mystical topics that can eventually yield answers you are seeking.

Simply engage the natural drive of wanting to know and exploring the mysteries of life without becoming identified with or overwhelmed by it, and if it becomes a source of confusion or doubt, then it is time to withdraw. Taking this approach will ultimately allow you to see clearly which answers have the potential to lead to clarity, and to discern among the wide range of possibilities what is truly inspiring and merits contemplation.

### Healthy vs Unhealthy

These are the healthy and unhealthy traits related to having an open Head Center.

#### **Healthy Traits:**

* Being open to inspiration and questions from anywhere and anyone, but at the same time, realize they are not your questions and it's not worth spending time and energy on them
* Not taking on the pressure of other people’s need for answers
* Always being open to new insights and mental sparks coming from who is in your aura, and you love to be "filled" with inspiration
* Enjoying the pressure to know more without becoming identified with or overwhelmed by it
* Withdrawing when confused or doubtful, and see clearly who is inspiring and who is confusing

#### **Unhealthy Traits:**

* Becoming lost easily, or overwhelmed by doubt and confusion that actually belong to others
* Trying to resolve other people's questions
* Taking on others’ worries and try to release mental pressure through action, i.e. "I want this resolved now!"
* Being occupied with questions that don't matter
* Are you thinking about things that don't matter?
