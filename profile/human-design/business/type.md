**Introduction to Type**

Your Type in Human Design determines your strategy for decision-making and how you interact with the world. Understanding your Type helps you recognize how to contribute to a team and navigate your personal and professional life.&#x20;

There are four (Aura) Types: Generator/Manifesting Generator, Manifestor, Projector, and Reflector, each with unique characteristics and roles.

## The Projector Work Type

Projectors are non-energy types who can make enormous contributions to groups. Yet, at the same time they cannot be pushed, they cannot be simply handed a burden. The burden has to grow over time. Projectors are best served in partnership or Pentas, as it’s not healthy for them to operate alone. They are here to know success, which is rooted in their ability to work with others. They succeed by guiding others, so they need to find a way to generate or manifest through other people.

The Projector gift is the mastery of things, mastery of systems, basically. They need to really learn their job, they need to do it, to experience it. They need to go through the process, to study it, and they need to understand the responsibilities. Ideally the role of a projector is to be able to guide and to be able to guide the use of energy; this is the fundamental truth of what they are.

## Building Management Skills

The fact is that if you're a Projector, you're automatically equipped for management. This is the whole thing to understand about Projectors. The moment you’re dealing with Projectors, you're always looking at somebody that needs to be focused on management skills, whether they ever become managers or not. It is one of the most important attributes of the Projector and deeply important for the successful functionality of businesses as a whole. And so, the Projectors who are involved in business, this is always a good opportunity to develop a talent.

The Projector has a focused and absorbing aura. It's so easy to recognize a Projector because their aura is something that verges on the exciting to the very uncomfortable. Your focused aura literally hones into the G Center of the other. Particularly in one-on-one situations, which is the best situation for you, it penetrates deep into the being. Part of that is the way in which you access energy, as you are a non energy type. It also gives you a special advantage in the way in which your ability to penetrate the other leads to a potential capacity to recognize aspects and qualities of the other that can be nurtured, that can be advantaged, or taken advantage of.&#x20;

At the same time, your aura is absorbing. So not only do you take in energy through your focus, but keep in mind this also leaves you quite vulnerable.&#x20;

## The Projector as a Guide

One of the things to see about the nature of the Projector is that the Projector is the ideal Alpha. In other words, the Projector is the ideal being to be responsible for guiding, whether that is as a manager, a team leader, or the Alpha One. This is, in terms of all things being perfect, the natural role for the Projector to take. It goes back to what the basic gift of the Projector is. As your aura has a deep impact one-on-one, this also means that you lose that power and create negative situations when you try to instruct more than one person at a time, because your aura cannot take everyone in.&#x20;

And it's ultimately your role to be a reliable guide to others. It’s your deepest skill, to be an administrator, to understand how to administer the energy of others. That’s an ideal for a Projector, after all, to understand how to influence others in that way.

## Recognizing and Being Recognized

So, as a Projector Alpha, you need to work with your staff one-on-one, and everybody is brought into your space one-on-one. Now, what happens to others when they’re in your aura is because you’re focusing so clearly on them, it can be a very positive experience. It can feel like you’re caring about them, are concerned about them, interested in them, and that you recognize them. It is a very powerful interaction, and it's in that interaction that the Projector has to play its guide role.

Recognition is everything for the Projector. Recognize what's going on, recognize what the other needs, and recognize what you need to do and not fall into the trap of your shadow. The bitterness of a Projector that is not recognized, the bitterness of the manager Projector that doesn't get recognized for the work they’re doing, that doesn't get a bonus, doesn't get a raise, that doesn't get a promotion, they go nuts from that. Nobody suffers more than the Projector in the business environment that is not recognized and rewarded.&#x20;

As a Projector it is your gift to be able to deal with systems and to easily assimilate systems; it is generally easy to get the information across to you. And again, this is the ideal for the Projector: to see the way in which energy can be properly put to use and make sure that this is where you focus your capacity and your abilities, your ability to understand the system, to understand the other, to give your full attention to those that work with you.

To succeed, you have to follow your interests. You have to follow where your potential for recognition is taking you, because remember: a Projector that masters a system is going to be successful.&#x20;

## Working with Others

Projectors do make ideal alphas because that is the fulfillment of what is their purpose, they’re here to guide. But they are not meant to operate alone. You’re either going to find a partnership, or it’s going to be the Penta. But it’s not going to function alone.

For a Projector leader or Alpha, they do not need to work with the entire Penta group but operate through a chain of command with a Generator. If they ask the right questions and get the proper chain of command in place, they can be the most effective leaders/alphas. Their gift is to develop invisibility—they can lead with such a smooth hand that it doesn’t seem like they’re doing anything.
