**Introduction to Definition | Information Processing**

Definition refers to how the Centers in your Human Design chart are hard-wired from birth to provide you with a consistent and reliable life force. Your definition impacts how you process information and interact with others. There are five types of Definitions: Single, Split, Triple-Split, Quadruple Split, and None.&#x20;

Understanding your Definition helps you process your specific approach to connection, and the optimal environments to meet your needs for greater workplace productivity.

## Split Definition (Partnership)

Well over a half of the human population have a split definition. It’s not possible for them to operate alone. It is either going to be in partnership or whatever the other possibilities are there in the design.

If you're a split definition, partnership is the most natural thing for you. As a split, you know you're going to be looking for that partnership anyway, so you might as well focus your attention on making that your business modus operandi.

We know that for the split definition, basically everything is about the bridging of the split. You are always looking for the bridge, so in essence you’re always looking for a partner. We could say that splits are really partnership oriented and that's very straightforward.

The best direction for you will always be to find the right kind of partners in your life. It may be the business partner, or any other kind of partner. The key is for you to know how to recognize who a ‘good other’ is. That's really the point. And the best way to recognize that is through using your Strategy and Authority.

As a split definition, you’ve got to take advantage of your bridges. You’ve got to be aware of them. You have to bring them in correctly, and then you can take enormous advantage of them, in that a bridge creates only a certain way in which the information between the various areas of the split definition can be synthesized.

As a manager, you need to get out of the office, go into the main room where the others are working, perhaps have a conversation with one of the employees or whatever and then go back into the office. That way you can get your split connected regularly.
