**Introduction to Gates**

There are 64 Gates in the BodyGraph. Each Gate corresponds to one of the 64 Hexagrams that make up the outer edge of the Rave Mandala (_switch to the Mandala View Mode to see this visually)_. Activation in any given Hexagram in the wheel is transposed to the corresponding Gate in the BodyGraph. It is the key ingredient for establishing Human differentiation. The specific imprinting is never general but specifically targeted to a theme within the body.

Your BodyGraph is made up of 26 activations. The columns on either side of your BodyGraph indicate the planetary imprint at two key moments of your life:

On the right, the **Personality**. This is the planetary imprint at the moment of birth and is coded in black (light mode) or white (dark mode) in the BodyGraph. The Personality represents what you have conscious access to. These are things you know about yourself and will recognize and identify with. The Personality is who you think you are.

On the left, the **Design**. This is the planetary imprint 88° of the Sun (88-89 days) before birth and is coded in red in the BodyGraph. The Design represents the nature of your unconscious. It stands for your bio-genetic inheritance, the themes of your ancestors that influence you unconsciously. While others will recognize these themes within you, you will learn to recognize your unconscious over time.

Each Gate will also be activated by a specific Planet or position, each of which brings its own quality to the characteristic of that Gate.

## Personality

### Gate 11 — **Peace — The Gate of Ideas**

A harmonic condition in the individual or society that permits assessment before renewed action.

#### Analysis

This Gate is about exploring ideas, and the need to be stimulated through ideas that can be shared with others. You look to make sense of the past, and depending on the way you remember and process past experiences, you conceptualize ideas that can turn into ideals and the formation of belief systems.

Keep in mind that ideas come and go, and this process is about reflection and the possibility for inspiration. These ideas cannot be used as guidelines for your own life process; this can only lead to confusion and disappointment. Ideas are to be shared with others, to serve as inspiration for their own process.

### Gate 12 — **Standstill — The Gate of Caution**

The quality of restraint and the importance of meditation and inaction in confronting temptation.

#### Analysis

You have a unique way of expressing yourself and can be very articulate when in the right mood. You naturally exercise restraint and are cautious about the way you express your views as you are intent on being understood by others.

Your unique perceptions, if expressed at the right moment and when in the right mood, can have a profound and transformative impact on others. It is also through your tone and the frequency behind your words that you creatively express yourself, not merely through the words themselves.

Art is a good medium for you, such as the use of poetry or music to translate your perceptions. With the right timing you have the potential to greatly impact cultural norms and our ways of interaction. If the mood is not there, most likely you will not be heard. This is also a gate of silence, and you greatly benefit from stillness and contemplation to let your message mature.

### Gate 25 — **Innocence — The Gate of the Spirit of the Self**

The perfection of action through uncontrived and spontaneous nature.

#### Analysis

Here we find the quality of impersonal or universal love, a love that naturally and unconditionally flows toward all life. This quality is not personal or emotional but the indiscriminate love for all living things, and expresses as surrender to one’s own Self.

In essence, the quality of uncontrived nature is grounded in the spirit of your Self. There is a mystical quality to this love that engages you in challenging experiences to test the innocence of your spirit, and it is this innocence that is your ‘shield of protection’ whenever your inherent warrior’s spirit is called out to compete and transcend the limitations of the mundane world.

This is the spiritual warrior ready to take on challenges that come with Initiation, to stretch beyond the limits of what is known and comfortable. With each step, the innocence and beauty of your spirit is realized and enriched, and deep wisdom found that can empower others on their journey.

### Gate 37 — **The Family — The Gate of Friendship**

The manifestation macro- and micro-cosmically of the organic nature of communities.

#### Analysis

This is the most communal gate in the Bodygraph; people with this gate show a natural warmth and openness toward others. With your friendly and engaging nature, you can hold a family or community structure together, bonded in mutual support. Your role is to ensure that harmony and mutual support are maintained. Your orientation is toward emotional connection with others, and your sensitivity easily perceives whether others are open. Others look to you to present their organization, cause or anything that needs to reach out toward others as your natural warmth easily engages others.

Your bonds with others, whether in a family structure or larger organization, are built on a bargain with your role as the distributor of assets or services. This exchange depends on your emotional wave and it is crucial that you take time before entering into any bond, such as marriage etc., where loyalty and support form the basis. You need to keep adjusting to the changing dynamics of a relationship and your role in it to avoid feeling trapped.

### Gate 40 — **Deliverance — The Gate of Aloneness**

The point of transition between struggle and liberation.

#### Analysis

Here we find a love of work, and you have the willpower to work long and hard. You naturally take on the role of provider within a tribal or communal structure, and to contribute to or look after the needs of those within your family or community. At the same time, you need sufficient rest, as your ability to work depends on your willpower, which can only take you so far.

You need time alone, to be able to step away for certain periods from the dynamics of interdependence that form the communal structure you are part of. Be sure to maintain healthy boundaries and to get the rest and time alone you need to recuperate. To successfully sustain the role of provider, it is vital that you are part of a healthy dynamic structure with those who depend on you, and that your work is satisfactory and appreciated by others. This is the basis of the bargain; your willingness to provide depends on the loyalty, appreciation and support of those you provide for.&#x20;

### Gate 10 — **Treading — The Gate of the Behaviour of the Self**

The underlying code of behaviour which ensures successful interaction despite circumstances.

#### Analysis

You are here to express what it means to live uniquely as yourself, which ultimately expresses itself as self-love. The 10th Gate is the Gate of the love of oneself; you have a particular role (of behavior), which when you surrender to it, expresses authentically as yourself. The way this is expressed is through one of the six roles of behavior, guided by your intuition if connected to Gate 57, empowered by your Sacral if connected to Gate 34, or expressed as your unique voice through Gate 20.

With this Gate you have a natural sense of how to behave as yourself, no matter where you find yourself or who you are with. You also have a keen sense of how others behave, which can almost lead to a sense of embarrassment when someone is behaving in a way you consider incorrect. As you develop self-love through accepting and loving what makes you unique, you in turn empower others to find self-love. This is a very important aspect of humanity's development as true awakening can only happen through self-love, being surrendered and committed to living life as oneself.

When following your Strategy and Authority, this Gate empowers your potential to live authentically as yourself. As you express your unique behavior, you naturally encourage others to be themselves as well. This is ultimately a commitment to being authentic through acceptance and love of oneself.&#x20;

### Gate 14 — **Possession in great measure — The Gate of Power Skills**

The accumulation and retention of power through skilled interaction, coupling grace with control.

#### Analysis

This is a deeply material gate that supplies the entire energy for the 'material way.' This is about having access to resources and material wealth, and the power and skill to distribute and direct resources in a way that supports our need for change and mutation so we can survive as a species. Inherent here is the power to follow one’s unique direction in life, which ultimately benefits the direction of the whole.

This gate empowers oneself as well as others towards investing resources that keep us evolving and expanding. You have immense energy available for any endeavor and task that you enjoy, and if aligned with your path, you are capable of generating substantial resources not only for personal gain but to be distributed so that change is possible and our direction maintained.

You have the skill and power to release resources in a way that supports mutation and ensures we continue in the right direction.&#x20;

### Gate 21 — **Biting Through — The Gate of the Hunter/Huntress**

The justified and necessary use of power in overcoming deliberate and persistent interference.

#### Analysis

You need to be in control of your own affairs and your territory, and to be given the responsibilities within your domain. This gate represents a strong force on the material plane and you need to ensure that you are in charge of your own resources and fundamental aspects of life, such as where you live, what you wear, how you make a living, etc.

You deeply resent being told what to do and would rather 'bite through' the conditioning forces of the material plane to exercise a measure of independence and control. It is essential, though, that you follow your strategy and authority so as not to encounter others’ resistance if you try to assume power or control over those around you, which you may feel compelled to do.

Ultimately, your purpose lies in serving the needs of others as much your own, and what benefits you will also benefit them.

### Gate 8 — **Holding Together — The Gate of Contribution**

The basic worth realized in contributing individual efforts to group goals.

#### Analysis

With Gate 8 defined in your chart, you carry the need to contribute something unique to the collective. This can manifest in various different creative ways, from demonstrating a truly individual lifestyle to being involved in any kind of artistic project. You need to attract the attention of others to make a contribution in your unique way, which will ultimately create an identity for you. This can also happen through empowering the creative potential of others, people who connect to you through Gate 1 at the other end.

You are attracted to unique and innovative ways of expression and can be a major force in helping these energies to manifest, such as working in the field of creative arts where you can contribute by promoting others who carry creative potential. You are drawn to what is new and innovative and contribute through calling the attention of others to what you see carries potential mutation, something that can change the direction of the collective. This is your way of quietly impacting the world around you.  Unless you carry Gate 1 in your chart (creative expression), your role is to recognize the creative potential of the other and promote the new and mutative potential.

### Gate 58 — **The Joyous — The Gate of Vitality**

Stimulation is the key to joy.

#### Analysis

You have a zest for life, and derive great joy and pleasure from being alive and in this world. Your appreciation for the beauty and wonder of life drives you to contribute your energy toward improving any condition that keeps our society from experiencing well-being and satisfaction while we move into the future. You bring a vitality to life that is fundamental to your way of being in the world.

This gate carries the fuel to correct and to challenge, to provide the energy needed to ensure humanity’s safe progress. You provide the energy to challenge conditions and patterns that need to be improved, to adjust things that are out of balance. When your energy is focused and channeled in the right direction, you can contribute things of lasting value to the collective.

### Gate 1 — **The Creative — The Gate of Self-Expression**

Creation as a primal force. The energy potential to manifest inspiration without limitation.

#### Analysis

Gate 1 is the drive to express oneself in a unique and creative way. You feel a deep need to express your individuality in a way that is truly authentic, a dominant theme for you. You have the ability to focus deeply on your own creative process, and while you demand attention, you remain unconcerned with opinions and ideas of the world around you.

The Collective with its established rules does not impact you, or how you express yourself.  Expressing your unique authentic being is rooted in taking your own direction. This has great impact on others, and as you demonstrate new ways of expression, you may be an example to others and even inspire them to take new directions.

For your creative expression to be acknowledged, you need to interact with those who recognize your potential. You feel attracted to people who carry Gate 8 at the other end of the Channel as they can help you exteriorize your work. This way you can become a role model for others and truly impact the collective with your creative work.

## Design

### Gate 6 — **Conflict — The Gate of Friction**

The fundamental design component of progress. The law that growth cannot exist without friction.

#### Analysis

This gate determines if emotional intimacy happens or not. Its function is to control the flow of emotions from the solar plexus, and you are either open or closed to intimacy. Here we deal with moods, sensitivity, and feelings, and you naturally create the friction necessary to engage in intimacy.

This is a mechanic that operates when you are in someone else's aura, not something you consciously or intentionally do. It creates the heat necessary for intimacy and possibly reproduction. Your body either opens or closes depending on whether there is a resonance to the other. In this way, you naturally preserve a boundary between your body and the outside world. There is also a fear of intimacy associated with this gate, and generally it needs gate 59 to break down barriers to intimacy.

### Gate 36 — **The Darkening of the Light — The Gate of Crisis**

The rule of cycles in which decline is a natural but not enduring stage.

#### Analysis

You are here to have profound and intense emotional/sexual experiences through which to mature. This process is about confronting inherent fears and vulnerabilities to grow through emotionally challenging experiences.

You crave experiences that trigger release of a deep reservoir of feelings and emotions. This can take you through cycles of extreme highs and lows; to experience crisis is inevitably part of the process that ultimately leads to change and transformation. This is a deeply challenging journey and your intensity can be stimulating but also easily overwhelm others. &#x20;

Over time, as you find emotional clarity through surrender to the inevitable ups and downs, you develop the maturity to handle crisis and learn from it rather than being overwhelmed by it. This takes you to discover your own emotional depth and truth.

### Gate 58 — **The Joyous — The Gate of Vitality**

Stimulation is the key to joy.

#### Analysis

You have a zest for life, and derive great joy and pleasure from being alive and in this world. Your appreciation for the beauty and wonder of life drives you to contribute your energy toward improving any condition that keeps our society from experiencing well-being and satisfaction while we move into the future. You bring a vitality to life that is fundamental to your way of being in the world.

This gate carries the fuel to correct and to challenge, to provide the energy needed to ensure humanity’s safe progress. You provide the energy to challenge conditions and patterns that need to be improved, to adjust things that are out of balance. When your energy is focused and channeled in the right direction, you can contribute things of lasting value to the collective.

### Gate 63 — **After Completion — The Gate of Doubt**

In the spiral of life, all ends are beginnings.

#### Analysis

The doubt of Gate 63 is experienced as the need to question those things one does not feel secure about, from the mundane to life’s bigger questions. There is always a risk when focusing this doubt on your life and choices as it is more naturally designed to be an outer authority; in other words, it is a tool for others and the world around you.

You have the ability to ‘see’ patterns and will naturally question a pattern if you see that it is inherently weak or inconsistent, and look for a workable solution—or another pattern. You are focused on the future, and therefore looking for logical answers that can be validated and relied upon to provide security in the future. If there are no logical answers to your questions, you will experience this as doubt in the form of consistent pressure until there is an adequate solution.

Here we find the root of scientific discovery, looking to test and validate a pattern to move securely into the future: a skeptical mind with a focus on the future, pressured to find those patterns that hold up to the scrutiny of the logical mind.

### Gate 64 — **Before Completion — The Gate of Confusion**

Transition, like birth, requires a determined strength for the passage through.

#### Analysis

You are under constant mental pressure to make sense of the past. Your mind is imprinted with a consistent flow of data, a myriad of images generated through the memory of past experiences. Underlying this is no apparent order, and therefore confusion is part of your process. Your mind filters and sorts through these impressions in an attempt to connect the dots until an experience makes sense.

Remember not to feel overwhelmed by the confusion, but to see it as part of the natural process and a preamble to the clarity that will emerge later. The perspective is to let the process resolve in its own way and time, as any attempt to resolve the pressure can only lead to increased anxiety and confusion.

### Gate 32 — **Duration — The Gate of Continuity**

All that endures is change.

#### Analysis

You have an innate ability to recognize things that have lasting value in determining the material direction and continuity of your tribal community. You easily recognize those whose skills are valuable within the structure of the community, to ensure its continuity through a consistent process of change and transformation while maintaining aspects that offer stability.

There may be an inherent conflict within you regarding the need to combine progress with all its inherent risks with the need to maintain a secure, dependable status quo. Stay attuned to your instinctive sense that guides you through indecision so as to determine what has lasting value and what only hinders progress and can be safely discarded.

### Gate 7 — **The Army — The Role of the Self in Interaction**

The point of convergence. By design, the need for leadership to guide and order society.

#### Analysis

You are oriented towards the future and able to see the direction that humanity is taking, based on an understanding of the fundamental patterns of evolution. You can see where the pattern needs correction and how it can be fixed or modified.

The roles we play are hereditary and mechanical, and through your role and understanding of society's future direction you are able to influence and persuade others to follow your leadership, or can influence those in positions of authority. You may be influential in pointing the collective towards a new direction. This role is not necessarily public but is nevertheless influential, “the power behind the throne.”

### Gate 17 — **Following — The Gate of Opinion**

The ancient law that those who wish to rule must know how to serve.

#### Analysis

You look for answers to the doubts you experience, and to turn these answers into concepts and potential solutions. You need to understand how things work, and you can easily see how a particular pattern works.

As you look ahead into the future, the fears that naturally come up can only be abated through patterns and solutions that have been tested over time and can be relied on. Any answers you find at this point still need to be substantiated by facts and details, and can only be expressed as opinions.

With a connection to Gate 62 at the other end, concepts can be expressed and supported by facts and details. Without Gate 62, you can experience difficulties in finding the language to adequately express and communicate concepts. It’s important not to get fixated on opinions that cannot be substantiated by facts.

### Gate 16 — **Enthusiasm — The Gate of Skills**

The great art of enriching life by the harmonic channelling of energy.

#### Analysis

You are skilled in many ways but need to learn to master any specific skill through repetition. You need to be strongly identified with a skill to dedicate yourself to a process that requires constant repetition to perfect a pattern (e.g. learning to play a piece of music). Then your skill can become art: the dancer becomes the dance.

Without needing a particular skill, this talent can also manifest as an art for living. You may feel insecure about lacking in depth; this can be overcome through dedication and consistent effort toward mastering a specific skill and bringing it to flowering.

### Gate 11 — **Peace — The Gate of Ideas**

A harmonic condition in the individual or society that permits assessment before renewed action.

#### Analysis

This Gate is about exploring ideas, and the need to be stimulated through ideas that can be shared with others. You look to make sense of the past, and depending on the way you remember and process past experiences, you conceptualize ideas that can turn into ideals and the formation of belief systems.

Keep in mind that ideas come and go, and this process is about reflection and the possibility for inspiration. These ideas cannot be used as guidelines for your own life process; this can only lead to confusion and disappointment. Ideas are to be shared with others, to serve as inspiration for their own process.

### Gate 44 — **Coming to Meet — The Gate of Alertness**

The success of any interaction is based on the absence of any preconditions.

#### Analysis

You have an instinctive awareness of others’ capabilities. Here, we find the prototype of the Personnel manager who can naturally assess others’ skills and proficiencies and instinctively selects the right person for the job.

Your memory of the failure or success of past experiences contributes to an instinctive alertness concerning survival patterns. You are alert to the needs of our survival as a species, rooted in an instinctive memory of patterns that are successful and support our wellbeing and material protection. You transmit this awareness to others and thereby impact the material orientation of your community/environment.
