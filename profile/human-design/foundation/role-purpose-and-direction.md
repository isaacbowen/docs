**Introduction to Profile**

Profile recognizes the basic duality in each of us—the synthesis of our conscious Personality and unconscious Design. Each of us lives out the combination of two of the six themes, or primary roles: _Role Model, Heretic, Opportunist, Martyr, Hermit and Investigator._

The keys to Personality and Design can be traced to the Line value of your Sun and Earth hexagrams, which we combine and call your “Profile” in Human Design.&#x20;

Profile is the costume you wear, a role you play in life so that your purpose (Incarnation Cross) can reveal itself and make your life performance unique. It is another way to differentiate you as a unique being.

### **3/5 - Martyr Heretic​**

You are resilient, adaptable and an agent for change. A main theme in your life is the trial-and-error process, discovering what does and does not work on the material plane. Your life is about experimentation and experiential investigation, adapting and refining as you go through a variety of experiences.

As a third-line personality, your learning entails bumping into things and people as if by chance. These so-called chance encounters provide you with the opportunities needed for your discovery process. You face personal and career challenges, because it’s natural for you to make and break bonds. But no matter what transpires, your secret in life is to stay with your process; you are not here to quit and give up because life is full of trial and error.

To be able to stay with the same thing instead of jumping from job to job, it is necessary to do work that is stimulating, and that continuously offers new things to do. In your personal life, you need relationships in which you have the opportunity to withdraw and have your own space, yet still feel comfortable in being able to re-engage and re-make the bond.

Once you apply strategy and authority and engage in what for you is a correct process, you show considerable resilience, determination and adaptability to move through the challenges life brings.  Often, you may be surprised to encounter a situation that opens up a whole new way. Ultimately, you are here to master the material plane and come up with truly innovative concepts.

Inside a 3/5 lives an anarchist willing to tear things down and fix them. Through a practical, experiential  process of learning from mistakes, a 3/5 either moves on or re-engages to find a way of making things work. Others project this capacity on you, and it takes quite some determination not to be deterred even when things go wrong, but to have the resolve to continue your explorations and fix things. You can then provide innovative solutions and guidance to create foundations for others to build on. Over time, your trial-and-error process will enhance the qualities of adaptation and resilience, and through your experiences you ultimately gather a wealth of experiential wisdom.

### **Type + Profile Synthesis —** 3/5 Projector

Throughout your discovery, you will receive a variety of invitations, often out of the blue. It is essential to be clear in your response and only accept invitations that are valuable and right for you. Only when you are properly invited and ready to accept the invitation will the experience be valuable for you, regardless of the outcome. After all, this is your process of discovery, and learning through mistakes is an essential part – but only if the mistake was valuable and contributes to your overall experience of learning. Others will project that you are able to offer practical solutions, and for a projector to be recognized is essential. Otherwise, the accumulation of experiences entered into through following invitations that were not correct for you can leave you feeling bitter, with a sense that nothing truly works.

In relationships and within your work environment, it is important that others recognize your need for space, to give you the freedom to move through a variety of experiences so there is a continuum in your experience instead of the feeling that you are simply changing and moving on. This way you will receive the recognition that allows you to fulfill your purpose.

## **Incarnation Crosses**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Introduction to Incarnation Crosses**

_“We are all very specific fractals of great archetypes. We live that out through our Cross.” — **Ra Uru Hu**_

Incarnation Crosses reveal our life's purpose. Our life’s activity is expressed as our purpose, captured in our Incarnation Cross and lived out through our Profile—the costume we wear. Our Incarnation Crosses are not something we are entitled to or something inevitable, nor do they automatically emerge as we go through our deconditioning process. Only when we function as our unique, differentiated self will the theme of the Cross start to express itself through us, and reveal the purpose of this lifetime.

Once we are in alignment with our individual path, our Cross and Profile naturally take over to express our awareness potential in this life. Fulfilling our purpose takes patience and discipline, as well as the ability to make the right decisions.

Each Cross contributes a specific facet, an archetype that is expressed and brought alive through us to form the world we live in. We are each an aspect of the totality and bring a unique contribution to the unfolding of the whole. Our Cross embodies the full expression of our potential for awareness.

An Incarnation Cross is formed by the crossing polarities of the Personality and Design Sun/Earths. The Sun and Earth are always exactly opposite each other in the wheel of the Mandala. The two Human Design Calculations are made approximately 88-89 days apart. If you were to place the positions of the Personality and Design Sun/Earths in a wheel and draw lines to join the Sun/Earth oppositions, the result would be a cross.

**Introduction to Right Angle**

People who come in on a right-angle Cross are essentially self-absorbed and self-involved. You are primarily focused on your own process. Though you may have as much interaction with others as do the left-angle Crosses, your journey is your own and does not require others to play an important (karmic) part. You are not going to find clarity through the other but only through yourself, and your own journey through life.&#x20;

### **Right Angle Cross of Eden (11/12 | 6/36)**

People who need to come to terms with life in the physical body and living in the physical reality of our world. There is a yearning underneath to return to the ideal state of being. They are often educators who teach others about the nature of experience, physical as well as emotional. They have a philosophical perspective about life and their own ideas and concepts about the world. They tend to point toward the experience of crisis and hardship that comes with earthly existence, often using the arts to communicate their philosophical musings.

### **Quarter: Quarter of Mutation**

You were born in the Quarter of Mutation, with a theme of purpose fulfilled through Transformation. In this quarter we complete our journey, and you collect all that you have learned and experienced to get to a place where you can accept the process and purpose of being in life. Here we look to find meaning and truth, to experience the satisfaction of a life fully lived and to attain our full potential for transformation and awareness.

## Nodal Polarities

{% hint style="info" %}
**Introduction to Nodal Polarities**

In Human Design Analysis, the Nodes of the Moon divide life into two basic dynamics: the South and North Node phases. The Nodes are not planets, but positions—points where the path of the Moon crosses the ecliptic—and constitute an essential aspect of our Design.

The South Node phase is the developmental stage of experiencing early life until we reach our Uranus Opposition at around 38–43 years. The transition from the South Node to the North Node symbolizes that point when we have reached a place of maturity.

The theme of our North Nodes sets the stage for the mature way of experiencing life after our Uranus Opposition, when we shift from the South to the North Node and move toward a place of accomplishment and fulfillment. During the North Node phase we integrate our learning experience from the first half of life.

The Personality South Node, through the Gate/Line it activates, illustrates how we perceive the world around us and the perspectives we develop about it during the first half of life. On the Design side, it describes the early environments that form the background within which we experience life.

The Personality North Node reveals the perspectives we develop about the world in our second half of life while the Design North Node delineates how we experience and relate to our environment.
