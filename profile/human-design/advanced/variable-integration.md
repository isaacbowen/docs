For each of us the path to self-awareness is unique, and experimenters can decide to practice their Variables at any phase in their life. Yet, for everyone, awareness through each Variable is built one upon the other.

It begins with the daily practice of Strategy and Inner Authority and the PHS dietary regimen, which enhances the left or right-oriented brain function and body awareness. This foundation leads to experimentation and discovery of one’s unique path in life, and recognition of navigation and course-correction.

Alignment to one’s path sets the stage for awareness of a unique perspective and its distraction through the practice of self-observation. This recognition of one’s unique perspective is the basis for individual thinking and awareness through personality motivation and recognition of how internal dialog impacts us. This ongoing practice of observing the mind’s motivation leads to communicating with others, sharing what we know when asked.

### 16 Variable Integration Groups

Variable Integration is the synthesis of all four Variables, and through experimentation and practice, what it is to live out your full potential as a unique being.

There are 16 different variable combinations, and each combination consists of a specific set of tools through which we can develop self-awareness—unique to us and different from anyone else’s.

In the next section, you will learn about your Variable group.

### The Variable Grid

Looking closely, you will see that there are four color groups: Orange, Green, Blue, and Yellow (the colors stem from the Variable grid, seen below). Each group represents a particular path and world-view, based on combinations of Environment and Perspective. You may discover that you have an affinity for people who share your color group, or your specific Variable combination.

Your Variable highlighted within the Variable grid:

### Your Variable Group: Yellow | Right Environment - Right Perspective:&#x20;

The environment stimulates the body internally through a relaxed lifestyle that enables you to see in a peripheral, expansive, and diffused way. These people are more comfortable as spectators to the world’s activity and see life with a broad and diverse view.

## PLR – DRR Receptive Being – Strategic Expression

_**Passive Brain** - **Observer of Action Environment** – **Peripheral Perspective** - Strategic Mind_

Your brain can absorb vast amounts of data when you are receptively present to your experience. It is a passive brain that aligns with its correct function through the daily practice of your dietary regimen. Through experimenting with your environmental path, you explore a relaxed lifestyle where you observe life, rather than caught up in action. Your potential is to see more than meets the eye—you fulfill this potential by developing your unique way of seeing life, how you observe from a wide perspective. This alignment of a relaxed lifestyle with a wide view becomes the basis for your strategic thinking and focused expression. Observation of your thought process and conceptualizing, and how you can get lost in it, develops your awareness of the mind rather than identifying with its thinking.

Experiment with noticing how people are an essential aspect of your path in life; and observe how they draw out your depths through your varied, but focused expression. It is through others that you can witness your depth. The key for you is to recognize that your thoughts and expression are for others, not for running your own life. Your relaxed lifestyle will bring self-awareness that arises naturally through being present to your inner experience.
