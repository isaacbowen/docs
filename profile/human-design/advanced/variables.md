## What are Variables?

_‘Variable is to Awareness, what Type is to Form’_ — Ra Uru Hu

Through the practice of Strategy and Inner Authority, there is the potential to experience life in a way that is correct for each of us. When you look at Variables, this shows your potential to experience individuated consciousness. That is, your specific potential to experience self-awareness, your experience of consciousness while in form.

Everyone has a unique set of four Variables, each of which offers specific information about how we take in and absorb nutrition and digest life, how to recognize our path in life, how we see the world around us, and how we communicate effectively with others.

### Left and Right Variables

Each variable is either left or right, which is shown by the direction of the arrows.&#x20;

The left or right-orientation of the variable provides you with a signpost for your unique awareness potential, based upon your particular combination of left and right variables, or variable group. By practicing your Variable, and observing your experience throughout this process, you have the potential to experience true self-awareness—your unique awareness.

### Left Variables – Left Arrow on the BodyGraph

Left arrows point to awareness that is actively focused, narrow, and specific. It is awareness based on intuition and instinct, with an ability to recognize patterns. Left awareness has a concentrated focus on feeling secure or not; or, curiosity about the unknown; or is experienced as an on and off again sense of pattern recognition.

### Right Variables – Right Arrow on the BodyGraph

Right arrows point to awareness that is passively absorbed, unfocused, and receptive. It is awareness based on inner recognition, feeling, or sensitivity. Right awareness has an on and off recognition of a meditative inner sight, and can be experienced as a capacity to recognize a wide range of feelings. It can also be a felt sense of acceptance of life as it is, both inside and out.
