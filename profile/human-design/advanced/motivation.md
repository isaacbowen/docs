## Motivation Variable — How Your Mind Conceptualizes

_The Motivation of the mind’s thinking and expression of Outer Authority, the maturation of mental awareness._

Key terms:

* **Motivation**: Your mind’s conceptualization process through which your personality expresses itself
* **Motivation Color**: Determines your unique cognitive potential&#x20;
* **Outer Authority**: Sharing your wisdom with others
* **Transference**: Harmonic counterpoint to Motivation

The Motivation Variable allows you to recognize your mind’s specific filters for processing experiences—how you arrive at your unique way of conceptualizing. It is the mechanism through which seeing turns into thought. Motivation provides information on how that data is compared, measured, interpreted, and then expressed. This Variable determines the unique way you think and conceptualize, and how you express what you have learned in life.&#x20;

Motivation determines your Personality’s specific way of expression—a culmination of your distinct experiences and the way you communicate them. It is not for running your own life, nor the lives of others; it is for sharing your unique point of view about your life experiences.&#x20;

### Introduction to Transference

The alignment of your Motivation takes place with the resonance to the Color specific to your Design. However, Color is never stable—if it were, everyone would have one thought. Due to this inherent instability, Color will transfer to its harmonic counterpoint, shifting your mind’s attention away from your unique way of thinking toward conditioned and homogenized thoughts. This process is referred to as Transference, which is when your conceptualizing is no longer in alignment with your natural or unique way of perception.

It is essential to recognize that your thoughts are not stable; your mind will never become fixed only to your Motivation. It is designed to float freely between your Transference and Motivation. The dilemma of conditioned thoughts, behaviors, and actions stems from the mind’s fixation on Transference. Over time, you become aware of this process, as your thoughts move between Motivation and Transference. But no matter how long you’ve been in Transference, through the process of observation your mind will move back into its correct alignment.&#x20;

### Using Transference as a Tool

The challenge is the mind itself. The mind is designed to measure and compare the current experience to remembered past experiences. The instability of the mind is required to arrive at new ways of thinking, understanding, and realizations. If the process is not allowed to occur naturally and you resist your mind’s movement, conditioning patterns arise that impact your thoughts and behaviors, and your communication lacks innovation and depth.

The ability to observe your mind’s Transference leads you to recognize the fundamental mechanical nature of the mind. It is a tool, not who you are. You can learn to observe the mind and recognize the signposts for the specific pathways that your mind uses. You can be aware of your mind’s tendency to become caught and triggered into conditioned thinking patterns. There is a direct link between a fixation on Transference to conditioned thought patterns and behaviors. The homogenized world is dominated by actions based on transferred thoughts.

The experiment with Motivation is observation—to become aware of the workings of the mind, which leads you to experience Passenger consciousness. It takes dedication, and a strong foundation in the experiment of Strategy and decision-making through your Inner Authority is vital. When you are grounded in your body’s authority to guide your life, the mind has the capacity of attention to begin observing your life—you are watching your thoughts flow between your Motivation and Transference. Over time, you may notice a relaxation within the mind, as you are no longer caught up in being identified with your mind.

### Motivation Colors

Motivation Color provides information on how your mind goes about conceptualizing and expressing. Understanding our Color, allows us to become aware of how we uniquely think about our experiences, and what we notice as engaged observers within and without. This specific experience is unique to each of us. The realization of how your mind thinks is found through dedication, experimentation, and self-observation.&#x20;

It is about observing the mind, not trying to interfere with or change what the mind is doing. You can’t use willpower to become your Motivation; it’s not about trying to control these aspects of your mind. Rather, it will occur naturally as part of your experiment—the practice of recognizing your Color signposts will lead you to experience passenger consciousness. In this way, you can train your mind to become your ally, noticing when you are in and out of alignment.

### Your Motivation: Guilt | Color 5

When you are asked, your mind attempts to break down what isn’t working or requires change. Rather than being lost in the mind, your ability to observe your mind’s movement about what can be fixed or changed refines your awareness process.

The Color Motivation of guilt can move your mind towards thinking about conditioning as an influence in the world. This is based on what and how you see. Your mind is a natural influencer, and guilt can play a part in conditioning yourself or others to get involved, fix situations, or change the patterns.&#x20;

Your mind is in Transference to hope when your thoughts are caught in hopelessness, denial, or how to avoid dealing with problems. In Transference, your mind is no longer processing data for recognizing how change can happen. Instead, the mind can be triggered into mental stories; your thoughts are on avoiding fear and anxiety about the process of change. The mental emphasis is on hoping that magical thinking will take care of problems and prevent issues.

When you practice noticing your Motivation and Transference, you may recognize that your thinking floats freely like a seesaw, between guilt and hope. Through experimenting and observing, you begin to realize the mechanical nature of your mind. This can be a shattering process, as you may have been conditioned to identify yourself as being your mind. As an engaged observer, you become aware of experiencing life while witnessing the mind’s commentaries. _While you observe your mind’s Motivation process, who is noticing?_

Your recognition of mental guilt and how that has driven your thought process becomes the practical basis for your expression of Outer Authority. You can recognize your transference to blind hope and hopelessness, and how that has directed your life into conditioning patterns to maintain denial and avoid your fears of change. This awareness gives your wisdom a sense of relatability and depth.

You can experience true Outer Authority through communicating your insights when asked, and it is correct for you to express. Your ability to observe your mind’s thinking process is unique to your awareness of passenger consciousness. This awareness requires dedication to experimenting through self-observation. The foundation for self-observation is the ability to release the mind from its role as the decision-maker for your life through your Strategy and Inner Authority.

### Left-Oriented Motivation

This type of mind has a strategic way of processing, thinking, and expressing that is focused and specific, which can be valuable to others. It is discriminatory by nature–specific details are brought into focus and others are excluded. This is a mind with an agenda or a goal. The Left mind wants to put strategy into action, which can be a temptation to bypass Strategy & Authority.

_**Example Left-Oriented Motivation:** People who identify water shortage as a problem that, when solved, will net a return on investment (financial, humanitarian, agricultural, etc.). They dedicate time, energy, and resources to learning about and becoming involved in it. They specialize in key areas and become a subject matter expert._

### Your Motivation: Left-Oriented Strategic Guilt

Motivated by finding solutions and fixing problems leads you to recognize how conditioning as an influence takes place in the world, from being conditioned to being the conditioner. You can recognize that conditioning is not positive nor negative, but rather a fact of life in the material world.

Your strategic mind has a narrow focus on interpreting and processing information towards universalizing concepts. It will only measure or think about specific aspects of guilt, such as recognizing how people are manipulated by conditioning to work together to fix what needs changing. Internally, your mind edits out anything that does not relate to your focus, and you will recall only what caught your interest.

The Transference of hope can shift your mind’s focus from actively thinking about how to help others recognize how change can occur. Instead, your mind is anxious about avoiding the fear of not meeting expectations. You build your wisdom by noticing your thoughts on hope, recognizing how your mind thinks about hoping things get fixed, or denying the possibilities of change.

_**Example Hope Transference:** Internally, you can become caught up in thinking that you need to change your life and that hoping for change will magically fix everything; or thinking that nothing will ever change, and it is hopeless to try. You worry about meeting others’ expectations that you have the solutions. Your mind tells you stories that avoiding fears around expectation is essential, that putting your faith in what you hope for will resolve your problems._

Minds with strategic Motivations are actively engaged in thought processes. You may feel mentally secure in recognizing your thoughts on change, a curiosity that stimulates understanding of what can be done, or practical thinking during moments of action.

Maturation of mental awareness is a life-long process. Your cognitive trajectory begins as being conditioned and moves towards being a conditioner. This movement fundamentally shapes the way your mind forms concepts.

### _Example 5th Color – Left-Oriented Strategic Guilt Motivation: Conditioned to Conditioner_

_In your early life, you trusted the outer authority of others as guides to fixing yourself. Over time, you become aware of the mind’s attempts to control and drive your life through manipulating the lives of others. Your mind’s conditioning patterns are shaped by trying to fix yourself while avoiding expectation fears._

_You begin to observe the mind rather than identify with being the mind. You gradually start recognizing that your mind is full of ideas about what and how problems could be fixed. Through experimenting with your Strategy and Inner Authority, your mental track shifts to recognizing conditioning as it takes place. When asked, your Outer Authority expresses unique wisdom about recognizing conditioning and how genuine change occurs._

The awareness potential is a realization of passenger consciousness. By being an engaged observer, you surrender the substance and events of life to your Strategy and Inner Authority. The integration of your seeing and conceptualizing takes place uniquely. This is the foundation of your expression of individual awareness through the pure communion of Outer Authority.

### Awareness Practice

When you practice focusing on noticing your Motivation and Transference, you may begin to observe when thinking floats freely, like a seesaw, between guilt and the Transference of hope. _While you observe how you think, who is noticing?_
