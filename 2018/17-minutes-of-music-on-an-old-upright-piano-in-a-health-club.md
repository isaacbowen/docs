# 17 minutes of music, on an old upright piano, in a health club

The last few weeks have been \*different\*. We're at the end of our travel, for the moment, and it is extraordinarily right that this beauty would cross my path, here, and now.

So. Here's 17 minutes of music, that we two made, for you, and your day. ❤️
