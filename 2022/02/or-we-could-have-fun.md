# ... or we could have fun

Ian Day puts it in terms of imperfection, and I’ll paraphrase him here: the process is imperfect, and it’s because of the imperfection that we’re able to progress _at all_.

Abe (who’s sitting next to me here) put in terms of _deviation_: “We have such solid patterns… but how do we make sure that it’s not _all_ solid patterns?”

The trick with talking about “fun”, or even in creating a space for it, is that it _is_ a matter of creating space—a gap, an opening, a break in the pattern. A _flaw_, even, in the pristinely regular, _so that life can emerge through the crack_. We’re pattern-makers, yes, but life _glories_ in openly defying the patterns. That’s evolution, right? A million deviations, each vying for their own next generation.

So when we talk about _fun_ here, it’s in the space of a quick wink across the room—because to even _dwell_ on the subject would defeat the purpose. We can’t methodically _deliver_ our fun to you, nor can we import fun from elsewhere.

But we _can_ make space for fun. We can check ourselves when the rhythm becomes too perfect, and in that moment we can suspend time, for a heartbeat, and in the next we can consciously yield to _play_. It’s an invitation to curiosity, an invocation of freedom—like parents to ourselves, we gently, fondly, appreciate ourselves for the work we’ve put into building _whatever_ we’re building, before shooing ourselves out into the yard to play.

And that’s a pretty good description of what Abe and I are doing this year. We’ve declared it, loudly, as a year of FUN, shouting mostly to ourselves, to make sure we hear it through the denseness of our own damn minds. :) And even _that_ I say with an inward wink, because _yes_ my mind can be so fuckin’ dense it develops its own gravity, and _yes_ I can have a sense of humor about that, and _that_ is just as valid a door to play as any.

We’ve found already that labeling this year as FUN has given us a filter, and the metaphor there is a direct one: some things just don’t fit through the filter, and the very act of _filtering_ makes us extra conscious of where the life is, and where the life _isn’t_.

I currently believe that life—at the highest level—_is play_. If I’m right, then all the dramas and despairs we experience are for contrast, or for relief (in the sculptural sense). And _if_ I’m right, then the “lightward” direction can also be described in terms of straight up, undignified, weird-ass, unpredictable, _fun_.

P.S. And if any of it ends up looking dignified or not-weird or graceful, it’s because we usually communicate in slow motion—and _everyone_ looks cool in slow motion. ;)
