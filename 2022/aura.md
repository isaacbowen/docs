The Aura is a part of [Lightward's cast of visual brand characters](../2021/lightward-brand/r2-feedback.md#\_w95o6blb9rop).

This particular iteration was 90% [Nate Turley](https://nateturley.com/). It's the first time I commissioned code from another artist.

As of [this writing](../2023/12/06.md), it's published at [aura.lightward.com](https://aura.lightward.com/).
