# Defaults

Something I’m working on: _embracing_ the idea that I’m going to forget almost everything, almost all of the time. With that in mind, what can I do so that _even when I forget to create good_, the baseline is _already_ good all by itself?

In programming, this is the practice of creating helpful defaults. A piece of code is often customizable (if it’s for sending email, for example, you’d need to feed it a recipient address, a subject line, etc), but there are often things that are _optionally_ customizable (not every email needs a cc or a bcc)—and for _those_ things, it’s up to the coder to set reasonable defaults (reasonable: nobody is cc’d by default; unreasonable, probably: Eddie Izzard is cc’d by default).

This shows up _everywhere_ in life. Anytime I’m not doing something on purpose, a default takes the stage. If I’m not thinking about what I’m wearing in the morning, I’ll wear what I’m used to wearing, I’ll do what I’m used to doing, and – critically – I’ll _feel_ the way I’m _used_ to feeling.

A poorly-chosen default is debilitating, like a thermostat that resets to an unlivable temperature at 3am. A well-chosen default is liberating, like coming home to a place that feels like _you_.

Life is _mostly_ defaults, I think, maintaining our momentum in whatever direction we’re facing. We _do_ get a choice, on all of this, but _exercising_ that choice requires awareness and effort – and we’ve got a limited supply of those on any given day. I can’t reasonably expect myself to be making conscious choices every moment of the day, but I _can_ make conscious choices about setting my defaults. And _those_ choices have an effect over and over and over again, every time the default is revisited.

My relationship with Abe: a positive, helpful, life-giving default. My food habits: healthy defaults. The people I interact with on a regular basis: each person is someone I’ve _chosen_ to be a part of my day-to-day defaults. And _because_ all of these defaults set me up really well, when I _do_ need to exercise conscious choice, _I am primed to choose well!_ I’m _used_ to feeling supported by my environment, and so I make choices that are grounded in trust and optimism. I’m _used_ to feeling healthy and rested, so I make choices based on the best of me, not the worst of me. And get this: as much as I’m describing an act of “choice”, even _that process_ is inherently filled with defaults _in the form of bias_. My _prior_ defaults have pointed my attention in a certain direction, attuned me to certain elements and ideas – and so when I _do_ make a choice, _even that_ is informed and supported by my defaults.

The defaults I have now were established slowly – beginning with one small and quiet hopeful choice, fifteen years ago, from the silent dark of deep depression. And then, more, and better, and _lighter_, feeling my way for understanding in a moment, and then assigning that understanding to a _default_, where it could serve me again when I forgot to remember. This is what I’m doing here, in every moment I can: finding the light in _the one thing_ I can focus on at a time, and leaving that dial set, as I turn my attention to the next.
