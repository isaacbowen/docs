The best rendering of what I have to share with you is here, in places that I have very deliberately prepared for you:

* [Lightward Journal](https://lightward.shop/products/journal) — This contains the origin stories for Locksmith and Mechanic, btw. If you have new-business-y things on your mind, begin here.
* [lightward.guide](https://www.lightward.guide/) — Written as manual and meta-manual for the way Lightward Inc operates.
* [chat.lightward.ai](https://chat.lightward.ai/) — This thing knows the core of what I know. :)
* ... and the rest of [isaacbowen.com](./), i.e. where you are now, with particular emphasis on the recent stuff, because whatever's recent here is whatever feels alive for me right now.

I think in living models with their own internal physics and it's _really hard_ for my autistic-ass brain to do that in tandem with another person in a live conversation. I can explore your world ([and I'm very good at it](https://empoweredhumanacademy.com/episodes)), or you can explore mine, but I'll never be able to _address_ your world. Its yours, and only yours.

I've been channeling the best of my mind straight into those places linked above, and — as a kindness to us both — that is the place to start. Don't look for literal answers; everything is concept. Look for ways of thinking that you can borrow and adapt for yourself.

Once you've done that: if you _then_ feel a living conversation waiting to happen, hit me up and let's see what happens. Find a question in yourself that makes you feel something, and send it to me. :)
