# Moving on

Gave in (to… myself?), bought a domain, and installed Textpattern. \[ laughs ] This must be… what, the fourth site that I’ve had? But I can probably stick with this one for a while. Hopefully, anyway.

Anyhoo, enjoy the site. There isn’t a whole lot here, as the site’s only been in existence for about two hours (-ish), but give me time and things’ll start showing up.

Also semi-related to moving on: the first term of the year is _over_. This is a very good thing. :) ... Yeah. It’s just _really_ good to be done with this last set of classes. Advanced Modern Lit was interesting (a bit painful, actually, but interesting), and Physics was… alright, whatever, so the term wasn’t actually that bad. But I am glad that it’s over with. Next term brings a study hall that I plan to fill with courses taken online through NTC for college & hs credit, which should be cool. $99/credit, which isn’t bad at all when one considers that there’s no other tuition fees. \[ shrugs ]

In any case, it’s nice to move on. Got a fresh start here on a website, starting a fresh term on Monday. Take a deep breath. Now go.
