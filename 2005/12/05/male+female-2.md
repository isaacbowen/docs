# (Male+Female)^2

Had an interesting discussion with Calah, Beau and Matt over lunch this afternoon, partially regarding the various aspects of gender in American culture. Things like why no one looks twice at a girl wearing a tie and how people would react if a guy walked into school wearing a skirt and heels. (Personally, I think Avril Lavigne looks good with a tie, but I don’t think that proves any kind of point, so… whatever.)

And here’s an interesting thought: if a guy is gay, then he’s attracted to the male sex. That would give him a female-role in whatever relationship he might end up in, from his point of view, so it’s almost some kind of slightly twisted male-female relationship. Same thing conversely with lesbian females, right? So the only really homosexual relationship possible, assuming that a gay individual switches gender roles, would be between a gay guy and a lesbian female. But then, that’s really a straight relationship, isn’t it?

... Yeah, that’s a little bit strange to think about, and probably something that you weren’t expecting to see in my blog. New things happen every day. Example: I found out today that Aaron Pierre likes trance music. Cool.
