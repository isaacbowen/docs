# "Work smarter" isn't enough.

1. … because the wrong work, done optimally, is still the wrong work.
2. And because we avoid the work we were not made for, “work smarter” is leaving us bored and diminished and _scrolling_.
3. IT CAN BE SO MUCH BETTER.

It’s a modern-day adage, universally prescribed: “Work smarter, not harder”. Do more with less, effectively. Not to do less overall, necessarily, but to make the best use of the time you’ve got.

“Work smarter” addresses _how_ you do your work. It’s compelling because its application has a quick turnaround — I can work a little bit smarter by degrees, starting _right now_, and I can feel good about that immediately.

But if I’m reading that statement as an individual, it does not acknowledge this: regardless of how _smart_ you might be working, _you may be doing the wrong work_.

I don’t mean “wrong” as in “technically incorrect”. I’m talking about the innate: by nature and nurture alike, each of us finds growth in some kinds of work, and finds harmful stress in others. I have two brothers, for example — one is made to build at a keyboard, and one is made to build in a forest, and to force one into the other’s context would be _unkind_.

This matters because the _right_ work for you is energizing, restorative. It engages you, and as you grow with it, you improve your surroundings, letting you be even better at what you do. The network effects compound: an environment where people are doing what they’re made for is _fantastic_.

The _wrong_ work is unavoidably draining, and you know _exactly_ what I’m talking about. And when the wrong work is wearing you down, “work smarter” lets you work less. Broadly speaking, you _will_ work less. It’s natural. You’ll protect yourself, using the tools available, and you’ll coast rather than suffer. If you’re lucky. If you’re not, “work smarter” lets you _double down_, and you’ll suffer accordingly. And so will everyone around you.

Now, imagine an entire culture where each individual is pinned to a career they _maybe_ got to choose in adolescence, in roles so defined that career-hopping is almost impossible. It’s _so normal_ to be committing your years to the wrong work, to reduce the stress by “working smarter”, _that the highest accomplishment is the escape of work completely_.

Take that in. Vacation, paid time off, _unpaid_ time off, retirement, or figuring out how to look busy: the universal goal, in a culture of the wrong work, _is no work_.

Now. Imagine another culture, where we _default_ to giving people the _right_ work, work that aligns their talents and personalities and purposes, a culture where changing your work is _okay_ because _people_ change and that reality is _respected_. Imagine what we could _do_.

Do you see what we’re missing?

This strip hurts. Because, in fact, the tech community _is_ working on this. We (I’m part of it) have the ability to build a single thing today that’s used by millions tomorrow, and _that makes us responsible_. Markets like Etsy and Thumbtack, even apps like Lyft, we-the-engineers are _trying_ to get y’all to your personal _right_ work, collecting the data, testing the algorithms.

You could say we’re trying to work smarter. \*headdesk\*

I’ve already talked about work in two dimensions: smart vs _not_, and right vs wrong.

There’s a third, and it deals with the future, running from negative to positive with a stop-over for neutral:

* Negative work: labor that damages the system of society.
* Neutral work: labor that doesn’t touch the system, allowing the system to continue in its current direction.
* Positive work: labor that heals.

_This_ dimension gets at the substance of the cultural shift we imagine. … and also now we have a three-dimensional fabric of work, and that’s totally worth exploring. Later. But we can get this far right now: a healthy society is one in which its members are well-suited to where they’re at; and so, positive, healing work moves us, by degrees, to having the _right_ work be the norm.

And this is where we come full circle: _working smarter is not enough._

Because you can do the wrong work really well (and you’ll probably hate it, and work less if you can).

And you can do the right work really well (and you’ll probably really enjoy it, and work more if you can).

But if you want the system of work to change, _you have to choose how you work in the system_.

This idea comes the closest I’ve seen to an applied ethical standard for engineers. We’re _totally_ capable of building really smart tools that give people what they’re made for, but still result in damage to the system of society. Overgeneralizing to make a point, that’s Facebook. It’s a truism at this point: nobody signs off happy.

I keep a running list of things I want to write about. It’s mixed up with the list of post-hoc recipes. The prompt for this post:

_as an engineer, my goal isn’t that you work less, it’s that you work on what you were made for_

I stand by that, utterly. And I’ll do everything I can to give you the best tools, and to heal the system that has so much say over what work you do.

But we all gotta heal this thing together. Yes, the engineers and the politicians (geez, that’s the first time I’ve grouped those two together) bear a larger share of the responsibility, by dint of their (our) influence. That’s a thing. If you’re in that group, focus up. Build with heart, build to heal. Smart is not enough. Care for the tomorrow that we share. If you’re not in that group, work with heart, work to heal. Be your best, be thoughtfully kind. Everything matters.

And regardless, _hold us all accountable_. Watch _critically_ for apps and tools and platforms and _persons_ that might solve your problem now but leave us collectively worse off tomorrow. Avoid even the neutral — prefer the things that are actively improving tomorrow, not those that do nothing.

Smart is not enough, right is not enough, the things we use and do and make _must steer positive_, and you get to vote with your choices, your time, your dollars.

LET’S GO.
