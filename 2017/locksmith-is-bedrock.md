# Locksmith is bedrock.

Core motivations are _everything_. They inform the choices you make subconsciously, which in turn inform your results long-term. (This idea is [suuuper important](../2014/pattern-recognition.md) to me.)

With that said, let me introduce Locksmith. On one level, it’s a security app for Shopify (viz. [apps.shopify.com/locksmith](https://apps.shopify.com/locksmith)). It’s a neat piece of engineering and product design both, and factoring in the reach of the merchants who use it, it’s easily touched a few million people.

Which is awesome, and I’m really proud, but this is not the point. Locksmith isn’t a love song to the world about storefront security and segmentation.

Locksmith is bedrock, and bedrock is for _building_.

When I went independent (having worked at Apple for a few years, with engineering management and platform development before that), I wrote a document called “Why, and How” for me and my two employees. It lays out my core motivation for running Locksmith, and then describes the core methodology for seeing that motivation played out.

I’ll discuss the “How” bit later this week; let’s begin with “Why”, pulled directly from our internal wiki:

> This project is _bedrock_, here defined as something _solid and predictable_, upon which one can confidently build something _interesting_, without the ground shifting unexpectedly.\
> \
> This project is bedrock for:\
> \
> … our customers and their businesses. By relying on Locksmith’s solidity and predictability, they are freed from a certain set of problems, so that they can better focus on the _interesting_ aspects of their own business.\
> \
> … us, as a team/group/unit. By operating Locksmith in a solid and predictable manner, we are freed to work on _interesting_ aspects of the project, heading for new and better futures, or to work on _interesting_ new projects.\
> \
> … you, as an individual human. By having solid and predictable responsibilities to Locksmith, you are freed to devote more of your energies to whatever is _interesting_ in your life.\
> \
> My goal for this project: to get us each closer to what we are each uniquely built/equipped/excited to handle.

In a sense, this really is security after all — the exciting plot twist is that it’s _situational_ security, the kind that lets you focus because you’re well-rested and have been fed properly and you’re in a safe place, and all of these things mean you can forget about the tedious minutiae of life and get on with the stuff that makes you feel _really alive_.

_This_ is the why. There are things I want to build — _really interesting things —_ and Locksmith is the bedrock upon which I am building them. And I’m establishing it as bedrock for me, by ensuring my customers can build their worlds safely and securely atop this thing that I’ve made. And I’m keeping _that_ situation stable by ensuring my employees can build worlds of their own, using their employment with me as foundation. (The order here is unimportant: everyone is inextricably tied, and we become _more_ stable together, not less.)

Why: It’s all about building, and being able to trust the bedrock.
