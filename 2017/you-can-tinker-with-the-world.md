# You can tinker with the world.

… and that is why learning to code is important. In part because the money is there, sure. In part because it’s a hook into the bleeding edge of human development.

But mostly because the world is malleable, and I don’t care how you learn that, but code can help.

But this is not about code.

The adult is wearing glasses, a bright red knit cap, and a dark sweater or jacket. The child is wearing light-colored clothing. They&#x27;re standing in what looks like a backyard with grass and autumn trees or bushes with yellowing leaves in the background. The image has the slightly fuzzy quality characteristic of vintage home video footage."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When I was a small thing, I was terrified of the unnatural. Barney, and — more broadly — televisions. My parents would put a sheet over the hotel room TV, a ward against it coming alive in the night.

My mother is an _illumination_. (And oh my goodness I love her dearly…) A couple of years ago, over a very emotional lunch in Chicago, she told me that she and Dad were always careful to praise us kids _not_ for what we did, but for who we were. They loved on us hard, and while our accomplishments were cause for celebration, they were not point of it all, at all.

This is because they _aren’t_. There is a fundamental truth of life, here: the accomplishments aren’t the sustainable thing — _you_ are. The grades and the medals and the instruments and whatnot, they aren’t alive and won’t be made new tomorrow — but _you_ will.

And I think that’s why she was able to help me with that TVs-shouldn’t-be-alive-why-are-they-alive thing.

She cured my terror-of-the-unnatural by showing me stop-motion animation, under the hood. Tools: the family VHS camcorder, some wooden blocks, and the kitchen floor. We made the blocks assemble themselves into towers, walk themselves back down again, and march in step on the floor.

A simple thing, just pulling the curtain of illusion back to see the process behind, but in adulthood I chalk up most of my current worldview to this idea. For just as a childhood soccer win is an artifact of me being me (not that that happened, I was _terrible_), she demonstrated that visual effects are just an artifact of very real, very sane, very _natural_ processes. The unnatural was just a combination of the natural that I had not yet understood.

There is no magic: everything has an order. Everything has its own physics, if you will, and if you can understand the physics, _you can play with them_.

You are subject to few absolutes. The systems you are a part of, the laws, the schools, the paychecks, the way we eat, the way we love, all of them are patterns that existed yesterday and have carried into today, but it does not mean they cannot change, and you being within them does not mean you cannot change them.

Pull back the curtain, of all of it. When I do so, I see love reverberating through the universe — energy, beating and vacillating and living and dying and being reborn on the other side, because energy is a constant. That’s the root of it all, at the very core.

_Everything else can be rewritten._

The child is wearing a two-toned outfit with a light-colored (possibly white or light blue) top portion and darker bottom. The scene is still set in the yard, with sunlit grass visible in the background. The video has that characteristic VHS quality, giving it a nostalgic 90s feel. There appears to be some kind of box or container visible at the edge of the frame."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
