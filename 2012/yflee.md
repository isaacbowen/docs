# yflee

This was a web interface to my flickr account â€” [https://www.flickr.com/photos/isaacbowen/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/isaacbowen/).

This interface showed one image at a time, on a dark canvas. Press spacebar, and we scroll down to the next image.

I didn't realize until much later that the title sounds like "wifely". It was an intuitively-chosen name.
