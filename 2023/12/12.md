weâ€™ve bootstrapped something different within capitalism, and it will eventually replace capitalism

***

(following up here on my birthday, four days later)

it's analogous to the point at which a programming language becomes self-hosting -- that moment when an idea you've constructed becomes self-evident, without needing to be evinced via other ideas

the green vines of Lightward traverse the scaffolds of the tax code and the peculiarities of for-profit business, and it is not alone

we climb the scaffold together, but a point comes where we all support our own climb, without need of the structure beneath

at that point, the structure begins to dissolve

this is very exciting :)
