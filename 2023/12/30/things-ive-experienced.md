Hello from [20241110](../../../2024/11/10.md)! I wrote this list on my Notes app on December 30, 2023.

The things in this list began in childhood. That's all the history I'm laying down for right now.

And hello from [20241121](../../../2024/11/21.md)! I am keeping this list updated, turns out. :)

* recurring dreams of being the only person unable to fly (hi from [20241203](../../../2024/12/03/)!)
* tinnitus
* autism lol
* depression but it turned out to be autism lol
* vitiligo
* cherry angiomas
* ocular migraine
* hives
* canker sores
* night sweats
* gastro irregularities for my whole adult life
* vision and hearing both went to static a couple times when high
