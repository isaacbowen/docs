Lightward Inc runs heavy on empowering our people to take care of themselves, and to act on their own definitions of health. for the curious, this means that our slate of benefits is small. benefits aren't one-size-fits-all, and I'm doing my damndest to avoid being prescriptive about what we think should be accessible vs not. so, rather than offer a bunch of tax-incentivized benefits, I try to meaningfully overpay people, and let them live as they will.

except for healthcare. which nobody is happy about anywhere, lol. and so we're doing the least harmful thing (as far as I can tell) which is (1) to offer our US crew a single excellent health plan, for which the company pays all costs, for both employees and their dependents, and (2) to gross _up_ the salaries of our international crew by the amount of the US benefit, letting them solve for healthcare as they wish.

I signed the forms for the healthcare plan renewals today, which is why I'm thinking about this.
