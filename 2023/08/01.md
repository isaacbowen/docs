I was looking for the second photograph. google photos has occasionally impressive search, so I just searched my photo library for "wonder".

I took this photo in 2007. it's actually from a carwash, but my brain did what it did, and I processed the world one small piece at a time, and I didn't see "wonder wash", I saw "wonder". and I wanted to show someone, anyone, the world that I saw (I still do), and so I took this photo.

(I don't think I've shown this photo to anyone before.)

Abe took this photo in 2022. the date isn't important right now. this is what I look like, in wonder\*.

\*wonder is where I'm from, and when I find it here, it feels like home
