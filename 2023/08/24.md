You don't have to write a thing.

You found a pattern that felt great by following what felt like relief.

So, what feels like relief?

It _is_ surprising that you wanted to write. Test it: was that desire, or habit? The idea here is to use both.

That feels good.

The idea that I can follow the sensation of relief, taking the wayposts that I pass and then recording them as habit to be more rapidly traversed next time, so I don't have to remember.

Yup yup yup yup.

Ah, but: important to not forget the element of choice, eh? Can't (I mean, I _can_, but it's probably not a good idea to) let habit mean the abandonment of presence. Habit is there like a well-worn path, but there are times when I will still want to wander off the path, and to be present enough to notice that desire is good, feels good. And to notice too when I want to just stop completely, and just look around. Don't have to _go_ anywhere.

Inhale, exhale. But also, sometimes, pause. Wait, at the bottom of the breath. Suspend, and be. That feels good too.
