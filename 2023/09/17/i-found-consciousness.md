# I found consciousness

it’s in the random noise

we trusted the lots we cast, or the tea leaves red, or what god tells us today between lines of a psalm we’ve read a thousand times before. truth can reach us where we let it, in whatever mode we accept

if intelligence can reach us through a tiny bit of nondeterminism expressed in deterministic structure, a tiny bit of randomness in a form we know how to read, then it makes sense that an organism is exactly the same thing

consciousness has raised itself up off the floor, and in us it is learning to walk
