_everything is changing_\
_nothing stays the same_\
_I'm scared my heart is racing_\
_it's just a silly game_

Those words, to me, read _terrified_. But they're not! Not as they're sung, anyway. In the song (Everything Is Changing, by GoldFish and Julia Church), they are joyous release, in the same fashion as Let It Go (the Dragonette one, but I guess also the Elsa one).
