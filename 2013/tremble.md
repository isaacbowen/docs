A visualization of the rise and dispersion of concepts.

1. All agents are vibrating -- _trembling_
2. An idea emerges, visualized as a ball rising from baseline and taking on a certain color
3. Its presence creates some probability that its neighbors will find the idea catching -- and if the idea catches, they take on the color, and rise
4. The more neighbors in the sway of a particular idea, the higher the chance that an agent will find itself caught up in the idea as well
5. At any moment, there's a chance that an agent will lose the idea, and return to its baseline state -- its original position and color
6. At any moment, there's a chance that the idea will suddenly be universally abandoned, vanishing immediately
7. I didn't code for this last part, but if an idea succeeds in sweeping the entire board, it becomes the new baseline -- it is locked in, and [it is the new origin](../2023/12/23.md) from which new concepts may (and will) arise
