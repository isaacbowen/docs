# 20201023

You‚Äôre here for volume ten! ü•Ç On the _tenth anniversary_ of an important thing, discussed below. That works out well. Things tend to, you know? I don‚Äôt think life could exist, if they didn‚Äôt, and we‚Äôre glad you‚Äôre a part of it all _happening_. :) Find a comfortable spot, and enjoy what happens next.

## ‚ÄúImagine how you‚Äôll feel in ten years!‚Äù

Isaac here. üëã I just got off the phone with someone on my team, talking about the week, about holding ideas peacefully until understanding emerges, about deciding to determine your own happiness (!), about throwing yourself at the ground and _missing_ (with eternal respect to Douglas Adams). Also, about teapots. üçµ

Ten years ago this week, Tristan chose to focus on a moment ten years in the future, in which he could look _back_ and say that he hadn‚Äôt smoked a cigarette in all that time. Without being rigid, with allowing himself freedom, he said to himself, ‚Äúimagine how you‚Äôll feel in ten years!‚Äù

This is it! This is it. This is how you create a living thing: _begin with a feeling, and let it grow_.

_Interjection: while I was writing a bit further down, Abe scanned the line above over my shoulder and said ‚ÄúEVERYTHING I PLAN WORKS LIKE THIS‚Äù. The more I learn about how my husband works, the more I like him. <3_

## **Making a feeling**

This last week, I celebrated ten years of building things for Shopify. (For the uninitiated: Shopify is a platform for commerce, and you‚Äôve probably purchased something from a Shopify-powered store this month.)

And honestly, ten years in, the thing that I want to say is that _it feels good_. Only that. :)

I was talking with someone a couple weeks ago, feeling out a potential future for our respective companies, and it came up that [this part of Lightward](https://lightward.com/technology) serves more than 8000 businesses around the globe. The person on the other end of the line said, ‚Äúso you don‚Äôt sleep at _all_, do you?‚Äù But I _do_, and it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve made sure I could sleep at every stage.

This is kind of the whole idea. Make something that feels good, out of _right now_, out of whatever you have on hand. (You have everything you need.) Balance it. Let it grow. Rebalance as needed; it _will_ be needed.

For me, this is only possible with specific focus on what I‚Äôm actually making.

I didn‚Äôt make a company. I made a feeling.

Ten years ago, I was in a context that was _asking_ for something that felt better. I moved some pieces around, I invented something new, but the point wasn‚Äôt the invention itself ‚Äì the point was that I knew it could feel better, and I found a way to allow that to happen. And I put the invention on a shelf where other people could find it, and I let it be.

I mean that literally, and strongly: I let it _be_.

And for me, that meant not trying to make this new thing _into_ anything, not trying to achieve anything outside of the now, because I had complete control in the now (and you do too): I can take whatever‚Äôs here and create from it a feeling, and I can share that feeling with whoever wants in.

I think that‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôve ever done. They say that people will remember how you made them feel; I suspect that _feelings_ are really the only thing that we _make_, and all the physical accoutrements are secondary manifestations.

So. Ten years. Ten years of creating balance. Ten years of passively monitoring for imbalance, not _actively looking for it_ (because you find what you look for), but of keeping an eye out for that flag in the back of my head that goes up when something needs adjusting. Ten years of seeing the Being in each of my ten thousand users, and the millions and millions of their customers. Ten years of absolute trust that we will always have what we need.

I talk about Lightward in terms of an experiment. ‚ÄúCan we run a company like this, where the _whole deal_ is to take each step towards the light?‚Äù I can do better than that phrasing, though. Because it is absolutely clear: I can run my _life_ like this, on every dimension, and that 100% includes that-which-convention-calls-work.

Here are some things that are true about what I‚Äôve done:

* I never took a big risk. Each risk was small. There were a few big _steps_, but each of those was a move made in absolute strength and certainty.
* While there have absolutely been moments of unrest, of little sleep, of worry or anxiety, they are in no way dominant. There is an overriding calm and assuredness that runs through the entire thing, and we never stray far from it. And, importantly, each break from that alignment teaches us how to better _hold_ that alignment. There are no wrong moves. It‚Äôs not possible.
* I trust easily. I did at the beginning, and I do now. This means trust for _both_ myself and others, which means that when I know something or someone will work, I go for it. The results are always good. They may not be what I thought I would _get_, but they are always _good_. (To explain by example: I once opened the hiring process for someone who was missing a background I _thought_ I would require, but I opened the process because I felt strongly that it was worth pursuing. While _in_ process, circumstances changed in a way that led me to _close_ the process, but the ‚Äúrisk‚Äù I took in even considering that person opened up their own perspective to new kinds of jobs, and they‚Äôre now in a role that more perfectly suits them than anything they thought possible before.)
* I have been generous. With my customers, with my team, with myself. (It took me a while to figure out how to _talk_ about being generous with myself, but it‚Äôs a thing I‚Äôve had for a long time.) I have been generous because I have always been certain that there is _enough_, and I have always found evidence to support that.
* Overwhelmingly, the lovers have outnumbered the haters. (And the vast majority of the haters just need to be given space, it turns out.) Consistently, meeting people with love invites love in return, and I have _ten years_ of positive interactions to back that up.
* It‚Äôs been fun. :)

At no point has there been a map. Each choice leads to an equally-infinite future, and so there has never been a need for one. I‚Äôve made choices that felt _deeply right_ at every turn, and the thing I celebrate ten years in is _not_ that I‚Äôve built something specific or achieved something measurable (although those things are all a TON of fun to recognize) ‚Äì I celebrate the story of an evolving flow, and I celebrate a long history of choices _towards_ things that suit me, in my health, perfectly.

Ultimately, I celebrate that I am standing exactly where I want to be. :)

It feels good. I started to experience something stressfully last week, on the _actual_ ten-year anniversary of some specific code I wrote, and I caught myself: _hang on, I‚Äôve been doing this for ten years, and there is no WAY that this scenario has ANY claim on my happiness whatsoever_.

Everything is worth celebrating, at every stage. And that line in the sand ten years ago is just one way to mark the time. And so, grounded in love for the story as an unending, un-beginning whole, I am wholeheartedly celebrating these last ten years. It is good. :)

\-Isaac
