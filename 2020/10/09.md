## Emotional autonomy

I have good news! YOU GET TO CHOOSE THE WAY YOU FEEL.

NO REALLY. And not only is it _okay_ to behold a context in which everyone is feeling terrible, in which the standard, so-called appropriate response would be to _also_ feel terrible, _choosing to feel good is the only way to break the cycle of toxic reactivity_. Like begets like, like attracts like, and if you want to create or attract anything _good_, you gotta choose thoughts that feel better than what‚Äôs on offer around you.

This is what I‚Äôm calling ‚Äúemotional autonomy‚Äù. It‚Äôs a little different than the psychology definition, which talks about it in terms of separating from the social fabric of your early development. And while this is similar, this is about _choice_ in your _feelings_. Actual, real independence from socio-emotional mores. Independence from your _own_, for you get to choose what emotional habits serve you, and which do not.

So yeah, I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about this. Feelings are usually described in terms of _reaction_, right? ‚ÄúThis _makes_ me feel _x_‚Äù. So it took me a good long while to figure out that I _had_ a choice about how I felt.

A couple weeks ago, my bit of the newsletter involved a spectrum of emotions, ordered by good-feeling-ness. ([Here‚Äôs that issue, if you want to look back on it.](https://lightward.com/campaigns/view-campaign/YfC5k4kLVCLSg87YLsR5CFbtJkKwOw\_eTfzIQeBxlSaUOmR44HEo794ktNrPl-bS-7xcA8x9YHgjgZVV817sS\_bLWGIw\_cuw)) It‚Äôs been my many-times-daily work to register a bad-feeling emotion, and to then upgrade it, taking whatever I‚Äôm thinking about and reframing it using the emotion that‚Äôs one step higher on the scale from where I started, then repeating to move higher still.

That process is predicated on the idea that you get to choose thoughts, and some thoughts feel better than others. It‚Äôs possible to just choose a good feeling and move to it, yes, but until you‚Äôve got that muscle strengthened it‚Äôs easier to choose a _thought_ that feels good, and let your habit of reactive-only feeling do its thing. Totally valid.

I say that quickly ‚Äì ‚Äútotally valid‚Äù ‚Äì but let‚Äôs talk about that for a second. Abe was in a shitty-feeling place earlier, and I asked him to choose a better-feeling thought about the situation. I phrased it something like, ‚ÄúOkay, you‚Äôve described this situation to me in a way that feels obviously terrible. That is a valid, real story. Now, tell me a story about this same situation that feels _good_.‚Äù And he rejected it outright, at first, saying that I was asking him to deny reality.

Which makes sense. But our perspective _is_ our reality. Facts are emotionless, and if you‚Äôre _having_ emotions about facts, it‚Äôs because you have a perspective on them. AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY VALID TO CHOOSE A PERSPECTIVE THAT FEELS BETTER. It is no more denying reality than staying with the perspective you started with.

Let‚Äôs take this further.

I‚Äôve spent years holding empathy up over compassion, thinking that it is better to interact and merge with the emotional payload of a situation, rather than to stand back, stand removed, and acknowledge the hardship without unifying myself with it.

(Sidenote: observe that the description above _obviously_ was going to be about negative and/or difficult emotions. We could do with empathizing with positive and/or easy emotions a little more, eh?)

It‚Äôs probably most true that both empathy and compassion are useful, and appropriate, in their turn. But if we‚Äôre talking about how we relate to the state of another, and if our priority is facilitating a movement towards health and life for _all_ of us, then the _choice_ about how we _feel_ becomes a critical piece in _what happens next_. Like begets like, like attracts like, and choosing to feel good is no longer about breaking our _own_ bad habits, it‚Äôs now about interrupting the negative-negative-negative reactivity cycle that society itself is engaged in. If the stream of self-propagating negativity finds its way to you, and you choose _not_ to sustain it, if you choose in fact to respond with good-feeling-ness, then at _minimum_ you force your microcosm of society to figure out how to _deal_ with something new. At _best_, you show others how to do what _you_ just did, and we all move up the scale together, a little at a time.

Can you feel how freeing that idea is? And why it might be a little dangerous to talk about? If you‚Äôre standing in a circle where everyone is bemoaning the state of affairs, expressing disappointment or anger at the way of things, it‚Äôll feel something like blasphemy to say ‚Äúbut I am hopeful that we will learn‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI am enthusiastic about our collective awakening‚Äù, or even ‚ÄúI am joyful in my knowledge that we are part of a larger system that is self-balancing, and that _because_ life wants to live, I am happily expectant that new, healthy forms that will arise, for well-being is absolutely available here too‚Äù. The reaction of dread and hand-wringing is _not_ mandatory, and you _may_ dare to be happy in a place where no one else is.

But start with you. Start with you. Recognize the freedom of choice that you have. No one has control over how you feel. No one, and nothing. Your thoughts are your own, your feelings are your own. And because your feelings are the lens through which you see life, and because you‚Äôre going to find more of what you‚Äôre feeling out there, _it is absolutely in your best interest to feel good_, so as to _access_ the good that I promise is always available for you.

Emotional autonomy. Tuck that idea in your pocket. Claim your freedom.

_Sometimes I gotta wear my shades_\
_'Cause there's sunshine dripping down my face_\
_Don't let these people lie to ya_\
_Don't let 'em see ya smile too much_\
_They only tryna take it away_\
_Sometimes you gotta hide from 'em_\
_Don't let 'em see what's under the shades_\

In closing, here‚Äôs something that came out of one of my work calls this week: _how we work is one of the most important things we make_.

We adore you. ‚ù§Ô∏èüå± Go get it. Have an awesome day.
