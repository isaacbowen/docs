## **Trust fall**

How do you feel about the fact that everyone has agency? What‚Äôs your relationship to the idea that everyone you relate to has a choice about how _they_ relate to _you_?

I think about this most in the context of business, feeling out Lightward‚Äôs way in the world. And in that extended exploration, I‚Äôve found this test important:

**As you interact with others, are you **_**encouraging**_** agency, or **_**discouraging**_** agency? Are you making it easier for people to decide for themselves, or are you working to force their choice to suit your preference?**

This creates an easy litmus test. The next time you encounter some advertising, ask yourself how it‚Äôs designed to work. Some commercials evoke fear, and promise you safety. Some commercials show you happiness, and offer it to you on sale. (The language of ‚Äúdeserving‚Äù is popular ‚Äì and deserves to be interrogated thoughtfully.)

Broadly, I think that the movements that _discourage_ agency are tantamount to operating in scarcity. If I don‚Äôt trust that there‚Äôs enough out there for you and for me, then it makes sense: to guarantee that I‚Äôll be okay, I need to guarantee that you‚Äôll make choices that benefit me. I have to remove your agency, force your choice, to ensure that I‚Äôll be cared for.

But that is not the only option!

**Movements that **_**encourage**_** agency are what the future is made of.**

If I encourage your agency, it‚Äôs because I want to know what you‚Äôve got inside you, and I _know_, for sure, that coaxing it out of you is going to be good for the world. It‚Äôs because I _trust_, absolutely, that all of us stepping into our personal choice will result in _more and more good_.

I suggested a litmus test earlier, and here‚Äôs where the full definition of that term applies: to _pass_ this litmus test, you‚Äôve got to be encouraging agency.

This is a massively important part of what I‚Äôm doing with Lightward. Our pay-what-feels-good pricing is based on this idea, that encouraging your agency is good for us all. Our every interaction with customers is based on this idea: though we do excellent work, we don‚Äôt give a shit if you choose our products or not. We _only_ care that you are equipped and encouraged to decide exactly what you want to decide.

Does this pay off? Obviously! There‚Äôs freedom in this, and _people like freedom_. People will keep coming back to places where they feel free, which means this stance of ours is a major contributor to our success. But to call this a success strategy would be missing the forest for the trees: life wants to be free, to act in freedom, and I think that whatever forces encourage agency naturally rise to the top, because raising those up serves the entire system of life, _which is about ever-increasing choice_. Not _more choices_, but _more choice_. More _choosing_. More _pristine determination_ (to borrow an idea I heard this week). And I‚Äôm pretty sure that anything that works in favor of _that_ gets an automatic leg up in the system of life, because it is acting in favor of the whole system.

Now, anytime I see someone offering a strategy for getting a leg up, I‚Äôm very, very careful about how I relate to it. And that applies here. But here, I think this is perfectly okay, and _good_, because this boost I‚Äôm describing _is not accessible to anyone who‚Äôs working to drag the system down_. I‚Äôm proposing that a business (but it needn‚Äôt be a business) is going to benefit from the nature of life itself if it encourages the freedom and choice and ability and power and taste and preference and determination and _agency_ of all of its customers. If I‚Äôm right, then a business whose top priority is growth _can‚Äôt afford_ to try and force a sale, because in _removing_ agency to achieve a transaction, they‚Äôve just sabotaged their standing in the overall system.

If I‚Äôm right, then life is irrevocably oriented towards more and greater choice, more and greater choosing. And it doesn‚Äôt matter if you participate or not ‚Äì it‚Äôs _happening_.

If I‚Äôm wrong, I do not care. :D For myself, engaging in this way is infinitely more interesting. To do work in this way is to be in a constant trust fall, because my every choice is predicated on the belief that encouraging _your_ choice is something I‚Äôll be able to do again tomorrow.

A trust fall is exhilarating. You cannot know exactly what the outcome will be, but in a trust fall you have _chosen_ to trust the _choice_ of another. It‚Äôs one of my favorite things! I‚Äôm learning to do it in more and more parts of my life, and it just keeps getting better.

In the spirit of all of this, I‚Äôm not telling you to work this way. This only works if you find it for yourself. So, if you will, watch those around you ‚Äì people, companies, whatever ‚Äì and ask yourself if they‚Äôre working to encourage your agency, or discourage it. (Or straight up remove it, because that happens too.) Develop your own relationship with this. And, if you will, let me know what you find. :)

Love,

\-Isaac

Move toward joy. If you‚Äôre not feeling joy right now, don‚Äôt try to jump straight there ‚Äì big jumps are hard to land, and if you don‚Äôt land it, you might feel worse. So, just take tiny steps toward relief. Anything that feels a little better is worth your time. :) You‚Äôre good, you‚Äôre good, and _you can do it_. üòò
