## Joy is my _job_.

Here‚Äôs what happened. (Also hey, you might want to grab the beverage of your choice for this one ‚Äì it is not short. üòÑ)

* Abe and I were talking about business, about where ours are going, where they want to go, where _we_ want to go. This was earlier this week.
* Abe said that he wants to make $30M dollars.
* I felt afraid. Immediately.
* I recognized my fear for what it was, and recognized that did not hold good things. I recognized that his desire is multi-faceted ‚Äì hiring friends, taking care of family, breaking the ceiling and insecurity he‚Äôs had around money in the past, _playing_, and just generally unleashing all the good we can with what comes next ‚Äì and that all those facets are good.
* I voiced my support of his desire, in an attempt to do the right thing.
* The fear remained, and I found myself suspended between how I felt and what I was saying. Untenable, completely.
* And Abe called it, immediately. That boy knows energy.

And _then_, I remembered that I had recently come across this emotional scale, in [Ask and It Is Given](https://www.amazon.com/Ask-Given-Learning-Manifest-Desires/dp/1401904599). The idea is that each emotion we feel lies in an ordered place on this spectrum of energy, and ‚Äì further ‚Äì that it‚Äôs _useful_ to upgrade your emotions one step at a time.

Interestingly, this model gives us full permission to step through each intermediate negative emotion, on our way to something better. This feels remarkably accessible: I don‚Äôt have to have crazy powers of enlightenment to just take one step forward. And to declare _all_ the emotions in-bound feels honest, and accepting of my humanity: no emotion is _bad_, and I don‚Äôt have to carve out and throw away some part of myself to move forward. It‚Äôs all valid.

The scale:

1. Joy, Appreciation, Empowered, Freedom, Love
2. Passion
3. Enthusiasm, Eagerness, Happiness
4. Positive Expectation, Belief
5. Optimism
6. Hopefulness
7. Contentment
8. Boredom
9. Pessimism
10. Frustration, Irritation, Impatience
11. ‚ÄúOverwhelment‚Äù
12. Disappointment
13. Doubt
14. Worry
15. Blame
16. Discouragement
17. Anger
18. Revenge
19. Hatred, Rage
20. Jealousy
21. Insecurity, Guilt, Unworthiness
22. Fear, Grief, Depression, Despair, Powerlessness

And so, grocery list of emotions in hand and with Abe watching and listening from across the table, I started from the powerlessness and depression in 22, and I literally took my energy 21 steps upward, in the space of 30 minutes. I cried, a bunch. I said things were not generous or kind. I was testing the system. I wanted to know if it would work to gradually upgrade my emotional experience, one halting step at a time.

I want to share with you what each step was like, as an example. You ready?

**22. Fear, Grief, Depression, Despair, Powerlessness**\
&#xNAN;_&#x49;‚Äôm afraid that Abe wants something I absolutely cannot join him in. I feel depressed by my total disconnection and resistance to this. I feel just completely dead when I think about it. I have nothing here. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing._

**21. Insecurity, Guilt, Unworthiness**\
&#xNAN;_&#x49; don‚Äôt know how to begin to think about owning this idea. I feel guilty thinking about coming into that kind of money. I‚Äôm scared to even think about \*wanting\* that kind of money. Why would I be worthy of this?_

**20. Jealousy**\
&#xNAN;_&#x54;here are people who just have no emotional hangups of this kind of thing. I‚Äôm jealous._

**19. Hatred, Rage**\
&#xNAN;_&#x54;his is not the first time I‚Äôve run into this kind of internal resistance to this. And I \*hate\* it ‚Äì ideas shouldn‚Äôt be terrifying, they‚Äôre just ideas. What‚Äôs wrong with me??_

The author encourages spending just a sentence with each level. Even if a level doesn‚Äôt feel like it perfectly applies, give it a sentence, just to get the flavor of it. 18, ‚ÄúRevenge‚Äù, didn‚Äôt feel particularly like it fit. But, this was an experiment, and to get the results you do the steps.

**18. Revenge**\
&#xNAN;_&#x41;be keeps bringing this kind of thing up. Does he know how this feels on my end? I want to give him a taste of this, let him know how bad this feels._

**17. Anger**\
&#xNAN;_&#x49; don‚Äôt know how to handle this. I don‚Äôt \*want\* to handle this. Our life is already phenomenal. Why are we talking about adding something that scares me?_

**16. Discouragement**\
&#xNAN;_&#x41;be wants a thing. His motivation is 100% pure. I know this guy. And I know what joyful things we‚Äôd do with that kind of money. And still, I don‚Äôt feel safe in it. This is hard. I‚Äôm bummed._

**15. Blame**\
&#xNAN;_&#x49;t‚Äôs my upbringing, my community, where I came from, the people I hung out with, no one ever taught me how to be fearless about stepping into abundance._

**14. Worry**\
&#xNAN;_&#x48;onestly, this isn‚Äôt the first time we‚Äôve talked about this. I feel like it‚Äôs going to keep coming up. It‚Äôll just keep being a thorn, and I‚Äôll just keep feeling stuck/hopeless about it._

At some point during this stretch, Abe said, ‚ÄúIs this going to be positive at any point?‚Äù. I hadn‚Äôt shared the list with him ahead of time. And frankly, there are a lot of negative steps. Humans have an impressive capacity for negative emotion. Onward.

**13. Doubt**\
&#xNAN;_&#x49;‚Äôm not even sure I \*can\* learn this. And is this the right thing to be doing? What if my reactions here just mean that I‚Äôm incompatible with Abe‚Äôs desires?_

**12. Disappointment**\
&#xNAN;_&#x57;elp, good show Isaac. Good work. Whaaaat are we even doing here._

**11. ‚ÄúOverwhelment‚Äù**\
&#xNAN;_&#x54;his is a lot. I have a lot of feelings. This kind of desire has potential impact in so many areas. This kind of insecurity has potential impact in so many areas. This is a lot._

**10. Frustration, Irritation, Impatience**\
&#xNAN;_&#x46;uck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck_

**9. Pessimism**\
&#xNAN;_&#x54;his is not going to end well._

But: each step was just a little less negative. (Do you feel it with me?) And by the time I got up to the inflection point of boredom, it was fascinating how much lighter I felt. Not good, specifically, but less bad, absolutely less bad. Fascinating.

**8. Boredom**\
&#xNAN;_&#x54;his is not news. I‚Äôve been insecure about this kind of dreaming, for forever. I‚Äôm pretty done._

And then. And _then_.

**7. Contentment**\
&#xNAN;_‚Ä¶ But it‚Äôs okay. I have Abe. He has me. We are learning together. I don‚Äôt need this to be more, or \*other\*, than it is._

**6. Hopefulness**\
&#xNAN;_&#x41;nd actually, given what I know about us, I see this ending well. We both want to learn. We both want to help each other learn. We both want to let in the good. I think we can figure this out._

**5. Optimism**\
&#xNAN;_&#x59;eah, I know we can. There are so many good places for this to go: releasing fear, being honest about desire, learning to be supportive, learning to be bold._

**4. Positive Expectation, Belief**\
&#xNAN;_&#x57;e have a hella-strong track record of knocking shit out together. I have absolute belief that I can learn from this, I have absolute belief that Abe‚Äôs desires for t-h-i-r-t-y-m-i-l-l-i-o-n-d-o-l-l-a-r-s are born of pure joy, and hold nothing but blessing for all that it‚Äôll touch._

**3. Enthusiasm, Eagerness, Happiness**\
&#xNAN;_&#x41;nd you know what, now that we‚Äôre here, I‚Äôm straight up eager to see where this goes. Fear doesn‚Äôt drive me. Growth drives me, expansion drives me, joy drives me. And I \*like\* seeing how this works ‚Äì the process of revealing insecurity, and then healing insecurity, and then stepping into more life._

**2. Passion**\
&#xNAN;_&#x41;nd I am fucking \*passionate\* about that process. I \*love\* finding the heart of a matter, of finding the tiny fiber at the core of the thing, and addressing it, pressing into it, making everything better by finding the one thing I need to focus on. I love, love, love that._

And bizarrely, I found myself at the top of the list, in full and honest presence.

**1. Joy, Appreciation, Empowered, Freedom, Love**\
&#xNAN;_&#x49; am fully, fully free. I always have been! I am here with my beloved, and we are together growing, expanding, and I am in love with this cycle: finding the places of friction and hurt and resistance, and releasing them, letting those parts of myself open into their fullness. I am full of love._

This bit is titled ‚ÄúJoy is my _job_‚Äù. It‚Äôs because I concluded, this week, that my primary responsibility is to hang out in the 1-7 range on that emotional scale, to be purposefully upgrading my negative emotions as they come up, whenever they come up. Because doing so makes everything better. I have more access to myself, in those emotional spaces. My work is better, what I _make_ is better. I _allow_ more good things into our life, into being. And _that_ bit, crucially, is how I interact with Abe‚Äôs desires ‚Äì all of them, not just the $30M. By hanging out in joy, I position myself in place of allowing the good _in_. Abe and I have different motivations, different desires ‚Äì and the way we support each other mutually is by hanging out in joy, to facilitate the full expression of who we are, and of what we are bringing into existence _through_ our desire.

I was talking with someone on my team earlier this week, and they observed the curious difference between _work_, and hobbies or whatever activities we would do just because we like doing them. They observed that, while you might hesitate to dust off the book or pick up the paints or get outside or whatever else, you don‚Äôt really think about _work_, because work‚Äôs non-negotiable ‚Äì it‚Äôs a thing you just gotta do.

And then, they pointed out that it‚Äôs absolutely within our power to promote _anything we want_ to that level of criticality.

So: joy is my job. I declare it so. And I think it‚Äôs possibly my most important job. Everything else may change form around it, but if I keep hanging out _in_ joy, if I continue upgrading my emotions through that scale _on purpose_, I know that I‚Äôll be allowing everything around me to unfold in its truest, most full nature. Instead of offering resistance, my very _being_ will offer love and the excited anticipation of what happens next.

I have this spidey-sense for when a principle addresses the heart of a situation, for when a simple idea has natural potential to make everything ‚Äì _everything_ ‚Äì better. This feels like that.

Thank you for reading this. It was a long one. ;) I encourage you to take that emotional scale up there, and take it for a ride the next time you‚Äôre seized by something that feels just fuckin‚Äô awful. Try upgrading it, one step at a time. Then, come back to this email, hit reply, and let me know how it goes for you. I‚Äôve been doing this all week, and I‚Äôll be doing it right alongside you. :)

Love,

Isaac

P.S. I don‚Äôt have piano for you this week. Instead, for y‚Äôall on Spotify (sorry everyone else), [here‚Äôs ](http://sptfy.com/upandup)[_six hours_](http://sptfy.com/upandup)[ of music](http://sptfy.com/upandup) that makes me feel awesome.

Did you make it this far? If so, kudos. Love you. This was a fun email to write. We hope you enjoyed it. We are so grateful you‚Äôre here. Go hug a tree, and whisper something happy, just for you and that tree to hear. No, for real, I mean it ‚Äì get up and go hug a tree and _make that tree‚Äôs day_. üòò
