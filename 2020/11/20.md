It’s a self-evident truth, for me, that life wants to _live_. And really, all we need to do is get out of the way. Just let it happen. Let every cell within you ask for and receive what it needs; let yourself do the same. I believe that the universe is wildly in your favor. Let it in, let it in, let it in.

## Freedom

We hit a tense knot of disagreement earlier this week. Doesn’t happen often, but it does happen. [Each one has something to teach us](https://gratefulness.org/resource/guest-house-rumi/), and in _this_ one I had the presence of mind to pause, close my eyes, breathe, and consciously let go of all my resistance to the process—and in that moment, I was able to wonder what there was here for me to learn.

And I _realized_ that I had constructed a system of gated emotions that looked like this:

1. I didn’t feel happy
2. I operated with the belief that I _wouldn’t_ feel happy until Abe was happy
3. I filtered and optimized my own expression and behavior, in order to try and steer Abe to a happy place, _so that_ I could again be happy

Which means:

* I had voluntarily given up my access to happiness, that access that I am _born_ with
* And, worse, I had constructed a system that resulted in me manipulating Abe into “allowing” me to access happiness again, _which is not at all how that works_

My happiness, my joy, my well-being, doesn’t come through _anybody_. We each have _direct_ access to Life Itself. My thoughts create my experience, and I can choose my thoughts; therefore, I have direct access to any feeling-experience I _want_.

All of this kind of crystalized in my head in a moment. And _in_ that moment, I remembered my freedom. And allllllll of that tense energy transmuted, and became joy. I shit you not. The transition upward isn’t usually that sudden, but sometimes it is, and on _that_ day, it was.

It was a fitting thing to remember, this week. Abe and I met in a space of freedom, back in 2014—we were both exploring, boldly, freely, more than ever before. And on the occasion of our anniversary, this was a palpable reminder: for as close as we are, we _each_ contain our own individual springs of well-being. We are _not_ the gatekeepers for anyone else, not even each other. The keys to your happiness rust away in any hands but yours—you can give them up, but they are only effective when you hold them for yourself. And remaining in this power _is_ a gift to those around you, and it’s how I was able to _actually_ optimize how I showed up for the rest of the process, while my beloved husband and I recovered our shared balance.

So. My takeaway, and again I am quoting Abraham-Hicks: _you are so free, you can choose bondage_. In the moment where I allowed myself to relax, and find the lesson in the moment, I saw clearly that I _had_ chosen a form of emotional captivity, and I realized how unnecessary that was. And _that_, honestly, made me feel incredible—both because I saw how I could choose better, but because I realized that I was _learning_. :D

A flickering flame. A moment of gratitude. Ascending through life. This moment has so much beauty for you to experience, and we are grateful to be a part of it. Happy Thanksgiving from our home to yours. We love you.
