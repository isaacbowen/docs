## Bright things

_Strongly_ suggested listening:\
[Chasing the Sun, by Sara Bareilles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFFberbflbU)

_You said,_\
_Remember that life is_\
_Not meant to be wasted_\
_We can always be chasing the sun_

Current mood. ☝️

I don’t have a ton to say today, y’all – I’m just happy, haha. :D The sun is shining in on us while we’re writing, I have [this puerh tea from the local tea shop](https://www.kuchatea.com/product/The%20Golden%20Memory/2421) produced by an 81-year-old tea master in Yunnan Province. (Kristen, if you’re reading this, thank you for turning me onto tea.)

It’s just good. 🥰

I came across this idea a few weeks ago: “You are exactly as happy as you decide to be.” I’ve taken it to heart. So many ways to argue with this line, but I decided to just try _accepting_ it to see how far I can take it.

I’ve taken it pretty far. ;) Give it a try this week! Don’t argue with it (though you totally could), just roll with it. When you notice yourself _not_ happy, remember the experiment, and decide to choose _happier_.

This idea, I think, is a big reason why I got through the entire election week without being emotionally owned by it. I was engaged, I was informed, _and_ I don’t think my stress hormones went up at all. And also, the last couple of days have been very long and _very_ varied, and I’ve had a great time – and, as Abe reminded me, this is a situation where last year’s edition of Isaac would have been in a horrible headspace. (Abe, reading over my shoulder: “Horrible!”)

Progress!

_“This is the real secret of life – to be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.”_\

That’s the whole deal. I’m happy. I love you. “There is great love for you here”, to borrow another line. Breathe deep, allow yourself to let go of all the weight you’ve been carrying, and just take in the sun. (If you’re in Chicago, interpret that metaphorically.)

I leave you with this, my playlist of shit that makes me feel amazing. [Here it is on Spotify](https://sptfy.com/upandup), and [here it is on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7Rfo9oMsPZDdCKhbQs6YyUqudce-WMAa). Enjoy, be it this or something else. ;)

***

I (and we) are writing this from a deep well of contentment, hopefulness, optimism, positive expectation and belief, enthusiasm, eagerness, happiness, passion, joy, appreciation, empowerment, freedom, and love. Each of us have access to each of those things. They are yours, because you are alive. :) You are _alive_: take it and _run_.
