# Heartbeat

I built Heartbeat while working at Enova. (Later, I built a successor: [1to4](../2018/1to4/).) It was for monitoring the health of collectives of people, using metrics that could really only be interpreted emotionally. The goal was to get at what really _mattered_.

The measurements were aggregated and published internally, for everyone to see. Each human's specific data was always private to them, but each _collection_ of people (and each collection of collections) had its data out in the open.

Reception was polarized. People mostly loved it, a few responded with deep, deep caution. It always created active, earnest conversation.
