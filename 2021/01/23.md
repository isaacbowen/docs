## Designing your days

For me, design is this:

1. Working to _honestly understand_ your own purpose
2. Exploring how that purpose would _express_ itself in the current context
3. Bravely _accepting_ the best, truest, strongest expression that you find
4. And then, _acting_

This applies _everywhere_. Everywhere that you have the opportunity to make a choice—and you _have_ that opportunity _everywhere_. Your work. Your hobby. Your friendships. Your _family_. Your cooking, your workouts, your _mindset_. It’s all design.

And it is _brave_ because a clear-sighted view, on the best expression of purpose in a situation, is going to _constantly_ yield surprising results. Whether you require bravery for surprising yourself, or for surprising other people, you are _going_ to find surprises.

Now, design is _important_ because it determines what the future will have to work with. The future will demand its own set of choices, and in the _now_ you get to establish what the options _then_ are going to be. A brave design decision _now_ means that _tomorrow_ you’ll get to carry the momentum of that decision, if you choose to, and it’ll be a little bit easier tomorrow because you’ve already begun.

I chose this way of thinking, a long time ago. I chose to _design my decision-making_—literally, to design the way I design. And today, I have a mindset that is tuned to weigh every decision, using that process I outlined above.

I’ve done enough hard things, enough _brave_ things that I’m no longer afraid of where this leads. I resist the surprises less and less, because I _know_ that those four steps, repeated over and over and over again, _by definition_ lead to something that is _perfect_ for me. And in the long term, it’s the only way to live. It can be uncomfortable, in a moment (or in a week, or in a year), but once you’ve _acted_ on a thing you _know_, the transition happens _once_. And then you’re _there_, in the place that you’ve designed for yourself. Even if it’s a small change, even if it’s next door to where you started. The changes add up. They add up, and you _cannot_ know exactly what they will add up _to_, but you _can know for sure_ that they will add up to something that’s yours. Deeply, honestly, _comfortably-once-you-get-there_ yours.

If this feels new to you, _try_ it. In the small moments, first. Figure out how it feels. Even if it’s just putting the dishes away. Begin with step one: bring fresh eyes to the situation, and figure out what the purpose is. Is your purpose to get things put away quickly? Is it to set yourself up for easy cooking, or easy setting-the-table? Is the purpose something less concrete? Is putting the dishes away less about where they go, and more about taking meditative space for yourself for a few minutes? _Think_ about it, _feel_ about it. Figure out what your purpose is. Then, explore how that purpose applies. Try things. Experiment. Iterate. This is exploration, without a specific _result_ in mind—it’s all about seeing how the _purpose_ lands most powerfully. And it may not require bravery to accept the results, since we’re talking about dishes here, but it _might_—maybe you have a partner who you know is gonna hate you changing this routine, or maybe _you_ have it in your head that changing routine is hard. But if it _is_ easy, great! Enjoy this gentler introduction to the process. :) Act on what you’ve learned, and repeat. Every day, at first, working your way until you are applying this in every single choice.

This is a muscle. You’re going to feel sore in the morning. But when you begin to _learn_, when you develop some muscle tone and strength and some familiarity with the moves, it _will_ get easier. And the results will get better, and better, and better.

I’m ten years in, doing this with my business. I’m closer to fifteen years in, doing this with my _life_. And I love this ride, y’all, more than anything. I have so much trust, such _absolute_ trust in this process; I have _knowledge_ that it all leads to good.

If you feel _any_ of that, give this a spin. Test it for yourself. Build your own relationship with your own process. It _is_ a ride, but it is _yours_, completely, and you get to begin where you are. You can _only_ begin where you are. The only risk is that tomorrow will be different. :)
