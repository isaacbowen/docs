## What is, what is, what is

Currently enjoying the _shit_ out of the following:

* The Expanse—the books! Haven’t watched the show yet! I’m just about to tuck into book 4. Can’t stop. Don’t want to, anyway.
* The Mechanic community! [Mechanic](https://apps.shopify.com/mechanic)’s this thing I made a couple years ago, which is now—like Lightward—being made by many people around me, too. This crew is getting it, and I am enjoying this so, so very much.
* The songs at the beginning and end of this newsletter. Go listen to ‘em. You’re welcome.
* My body! God I love being in this body. I love rolling around naked in the snow, I love carving easy lines down the street on a onewheel, I love lifting heavy things and I love sleeping and fucking and every dance in between.
* My team, my team, my team. My team. They’re the best, every single one of ‘em.
* The delicious anticipation of our first flight in forever. Booked the tickets. It’s gonna happen. Lifting off again is going to be amazing.
* Every errant physical or emotional or relational scrape or bruise, and being able to laugh in the pain because I _know_ its place in the flow.
* Freedom, freedom, freedom. Inhabiting this, our birthright.
* The frankly absurd number of candles on our coffee table. This rectangular hunk of black stone littered with (one, two…) _eleven_ different candles, all at this moment burning, and every single one in a different vessel. Wonderful. Why not.
* Co-Star! [Here I am](https://www.costarastrology.com/isaacbowen), and that is _true_, best as I can tell.

Speaking of that, here’s a thing Co-Star said to me today:

_To really love someone, learn how to be alone._

I’m paraphrasing; must have dismissed the original notification. But! This line makes a lot of sense to me today.

I am able to give the best of myself when the best of myself is not dependent or contingent on anyone/anything being a certain way.

I was wondering how I was going to be able to describe this, but that line ☝️ really does it well.

I have access to the best of myself, no matter what. No matter who’s doing what, no matter what’s doing who. No matter whether the object or subject of my love is near or far or connected or estranged.

It is delightful to be with someone who knows this themselves. And also I have access to delight regardless, even if they don’t (in a given moment) remember their own. I can still see their light, their inner wisdom working itself free, solving for itself, loosening to let essence breathe.

Interestingly, I can hold that perspective with myself, too. My current understanding of _what is_ holds that this points to the boundary between my greater mind and my physical identity: my true self, my broader awareness, can hold my physical stress and confusion and uncertainty with that same love, and that gentle, all-accepting enjoyment.

Those are some things. :) For the record, life is feeling like a cool drink of water at 3am, and—with the immediacy of sensation and absence of context that one has, waking at 3am—I roll over and wish you sweet dreams, and sweet mornings after.
