I think I just want to _understand_. I think that‚Äôs part of what Lightward _is_, for me: my quest to understand _how this all works_. To understand how to make something good ([_oh_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuMz4v5PYKc)), to try out the things I‚Äôm beginning to understand ([üèé](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmFtSQBMRmQ)), to slowly develop an elementary mastery ([_rising in my head_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfnRTifSWh0)), to see what can only be seen ([_seen_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOIe7sU9KAg)) once you‚Äôve gained the ground ([_here we are_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDzsqwkAP5A)), and to then try, _try_, to understand _that_ ([_never/always_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_mTRvJ9fugM)).

## I do not need to go to a place of suffering to gain permission to change what I‚Äôm doing.

Second-shot symptoms. Good things, honestly. I was up at 3am, starting to feel the onset, and I became aware of this thought I was having: _kinda hope that this hits me in a serious enough way that I can justify stepping away from everything for a day_.

SUPER FUCKING HAPPY I caught that thought as it was passing by.

Hear me (and I‚Äôm talking to myself here, but you can listen in if it‚Äôs useful): IF AN ATTRIBUTE OF ILLNESS LOOKS ATTRACTIVE THERE IS SOMETHING TO EXAMINE.

Life is in a constant state of approaching balance, tipping over the equilibrium, and re-approaching balance from the other direction.

I am a tad out of balance. Not hugely, but enough to want something to change. And it‚Äôs clear that part of my hesitance to change has something to do with external perception, because I found myself half-hoping that I would fall into circumstances (i.e. obvious illness) that others would respect enough to find my absence justified.

Not useful. Temporarily, maybe, as a path to better ends, but that‚Äôs not a _necessary_ path.

If I want a change, I don‚Äôt have to go to a place of suffering to justify it.‚Äîto _anyone_, be they an external observer or _myself_.

I‚Äôm feeling much better today. My brain is more aligned, I‚Äôm having a much easier time seeing the good, feeling the next step. I know I have some things to change. And, happily, I know that I have access to that change _directly_. There‚Äôs no pain-toll, except that which I create for myself, and I _decline_.
