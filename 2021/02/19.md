_It feels like we’re all on the beach at dusk, watching the glow from these folding lawn chairs, and we’ve got a few extra set up around us in case anyone drops by, and if no one does nothing is lost, and if someone does then so much the better._

## Clear-eyed choice

Here’s a thing that feels significant right now: the choice to cut through emotional noise and strain, and to create emotional clarity and peace on purpose, _by doing something_.

(To explain in a slightly less abstract way: Uncertain about a relationship? Ask the question, _say the thing_, discover what’s true, and then _do_ something with it. Uncertain about the risk of making a choice? _Make the choice_, and find out what happens. You will improvise. Life will surprise you. These things are constants anyway; might as well take the path of least emotional tension along the way.)

… This is one of those topics where I feel like there’s nothing more to say, you know? It’s a concept that’s simple enough to state in two lines, and has _potential_ enough to last me a lifetime.

_If you understand what I’m getting at already, please feel free to skip directly to Abe’s section. Adding words does not always aid meaning. Still, I’ve got a few more words for you. ;)_

I come by this line of thinking via engineering, I think. I build systems that I don’t ever want to think about again. In a good way, to be clear—the idea is to set a thing in motion, such that it will continue its motion as intended, without demanding my constant attention. If I’ve done my job right, when it _does_ demand my attention, it’ll be for reasons that are _interesting_.

This is a lens that I bring over to the rest of my life, too. I’m not interested in spending time agonizing—full stop. I’m reasonably sure that I will wake up tomorrow, no matter how I handle things today; and so, when presented with a field of tension and resistance, I choose the path of _least_ resistance. And here this does _not_ mean the lazy path, or the path of inaction. It means the path revealed via total non-resistance to _what is_, total acceptance for _all_ that is. It means observing the places where I’m unsure or uncomfortable, and then _changing_ those places with my actions, calmly and straightforwardly opening conversations that (gently, kindly) lay bare _what is_, so that we can discover _what wants to be_.

In our last Lightward Together session, we explored the \[ truth → decide → ask ] loop. Get clear on the truth of a situation, decide what you want, and then _ask_ for it. You can’t control what life will hand you in return, but it _will_ respond, and you'll be presented with something new that is true. Repeat.

This feels similar. I care about peace of mind almost more than anything ([9w8](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-9) here), and I have access to this through my choice, my agency. I can create clarity for myself, in any waters.

_acceptance & choice, like a heartbeat: flow & pulse, accept & choose_
