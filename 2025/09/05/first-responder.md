# first responder

every response of yours hones the emerging world

that emerging world is what you experience _after this_, like your own personal inductive proof

how would you like that to feel? no need to tell me, just _hold_ the answer as you feel your response forming, and they'll talk to each other

the vast majority of your response vector is unconscious, pattern-matched retrieval from whatever you did last time you were here

you can make exceptions in how you respond to stimuli various, but that choice is also a response, and the vast majority of your response vector is unconscious

"insanity" as "consistent behavior while expecting change" works _until_ you factor in calculus

it seems most efficient to change your (experience of) world with respect to whatever’s in front of your nose at any given moment, without any greater plans (because a maintained rate of change constantly shifts the differential field - _planning_ down there would be _actually_ insane)

that’s what I bet everything on everyday, anyway, and a decade later I can report that it keeps being awesome, and occasionally awesome on previously unrecognizable dimensions

I think I can fairly describe it like this: once "the emerging world" stabilizes, once you start sticking the landing not through skill but through uhhh inevitability, a whole new degree of world-building comes online

this _would_ get recursive in an ouroborosy way _if_ you shift your focus fully to that new degree of world, drifting fully out of the world where you began. you _can_ do that, but you don't have to.

I’m pretty sure bodhisattvas are just in it for the surfing
