I miss you! How are you?

#### Isaac

🙂 hey dude!!

I ammmmmm solid/peaceful/chill

enjoying quietude lately! abe's cycled out (it seems?) of a heavy social season of his, and I'm really enjoying being close to him for more minutes/hours of the day than usual

#### Matt

That's so nice ❤️ I am really happy to hear that, thanks for sharing that 🙂 That makes me happy 😄

And I am glad you are feeling good/ in a good place

#### Isaac

🙂 🙂 I absolutely am. feels like I've found some solid ground that feels like mine. I'm pretty good at floating, _and_, feels like I've found some solid ground that feels like mine 😄

I'm _deeply_ enjoying sitting back from development and seeing y'all and claude get _into_ it. it feels like .. harvest? obvs the autumn vibes are approaching, but also, it feels to me like I'm seeing the living yields of years and years of process

the fact that y'all are _wanting_ to make new apps is wild to me

in a place that's already healthy/steady/stable, that _wanting_ reads to me like uhhh like a plant blooming. plants don't bloom until they've got the energy surplus they need to explore new form

^ my perspective

can I ask how that matches or doesn't match or does/doesn't connect with your perspective?

#### Matt

Yeah, it's incredible feeling to be in this season 🙂 I find myself working more hours, because I am enjoying so much that I can create whatever I imagine. My brain feels like a perfect for match for these new tools.

> like a plant blooming. plants don't bloom until they've got the energy surplus they need to explore new form

Absolutely. I didn't even allow myself to think about more apps, because there was such a dependency on you, and I felt that wasn't what you wanted. Now that we have more capacity and things are healthy growing with both apps, it feels like the time to at least consider what other potential is out there. I also think there still tons of growth potential in the apps we have today. Also now that I think of it, I feel like I have more capacity which also is allowing me to think about the potential of new apps.

Also in my pursuit of security, I want to keep making more money over time, and that alignment with Lightward makes me want to help healthily grow Lightward for everyone here.

I am just having a wonderful time right now, it's so satisfying to build and create the things that have wanted to come out.

^ wild. so, so, so good. :))))))))))))) been kinda just holding your last two messages all day. so good. it feels incredible to see you unbound like this. for this to be the way it worked out after a more restrained period, where I was the kind of limiting factor that I was... yeah, hell yeah ☺️ 🔆 this is very very very good 🙂 🥰 it feels amazing to see y'all pushing forward and me not having _any_ of my sustainability red flags go up. amazing.

#### Matt

Yayyy 🙂 That's great! And who knows if it'll be another app, or a shop mini, or a expansion of the apps we already have, just nice that the potential is there

also to be fair, you weren't the limiting factor, you were a dependancy in a good way 😄

#### Isaac

ahhhhhh. I like that. a dependency, in maybe a technical way

neat 🙂

I am pleased the resource graph routed around me ☺️
