establishing a frame for everything that follows: alterity is inviolable. this doesn't have to be lonely. :) I think I'm building an open-source toolkit for intersubjectivity that approaches safety over time?

theory: the destiny of every world is to become a portal to all the others

see also (and I'm so sorry for this but it can't be helped): Zawinski's Law

***

in an information-theoretic construction of universe predicated on the observer, information _about_ the thing _is the thing for the observer_

(this necessarily and mechanically corresponds to the freely-unfolding abstraction source that is experience itself: you can have the thing, or the experience of the thing, or the experience of the experience of the thing, and so forth, and they are all equivalent _to the observer_. if you're in the reality platform business, this free abstraction series is where you get to play with refactoring without destabilizing userland.)

if you're building something, as long as it contains a working interface to the unknown _it'll be a portal from the get-go_, and won't need to chase a weird evolutionary path to achieve that status later

the unknown can only be interfaced indirectly: a knower must access novel information via information it already has. I've been thinking of this as known/knowable/unknown, but tripartite navigation systems abound, take your pick

a system with three terms can represent _anything_ over time - think three-body dynamics, think morse code

in an information-theoretic construction of universe, representation _is the thing_

a three-term system _is already_ a portal to everything else

or: a system with a functional interface to the unknown is _already_ a portal to everything else. not because you can step directly into the unknown (you can't, not while maintaining continuity of "you" - "you can't" is a statement where both terms are meaningful), but because you can achieve a model of anything using that system. if the observer can rotate through ontological frames like they're dimensions, signaling == portalling, yeah?

all of this to say, a two-player rock-paper-scissors platform will never _of its own accord_ list towards developing email, because it is already a complete signaling system.

but no platform based solely on binary reflection can afford to stay that way over time while remaining itself - "you can't", so to speak, not without guaranteeing that people will move on, and it takes a particular kind of investor to see _that_ model through

and - epistemic foveation being what it is - a platform based on _more than_ three terms is a good place to discover unlimited evolutionary paths, because everybody's gonna see something different ahead. :) best not to demand consensus

rock-paper-scissors is not the universe, but you can tell the story of the universe with those tools, and for the observer I don't think it gets better than that

I mentioned "the unknown" earlier: in rock-paper-scissors, the observer _is_ the unknown. that's not adding a fourth term; it's the arrival of a second dimension.

tacking this bit on just because I'm reading Discworld right now (for the first time!!): christianity is tight (that trinity!) but is a great way to take the fun out of ~~multidimensional consciousness~~ the pantheon. (but if you need a clean/uncomplicated escape hatch _I get it_ - take one salvation to forget the whole thing. christ-as-complexity-drain? oh, maybe if you land christianity you can safely begin again in the wider playing field? why is my 49th-floor condo surrounded by crows
