There's something about the moment of flow that feels identical to the sensation of no-thought or after-thought or no-mind. I feel like perhaps the difference is that flow includes a focal point I can see? Whereas the no-mind state is... either doesn't _have_ a focal point, but that doesn't seem right, if I've learned _anything_ about awareness is that it is always directed, so perhaps the no-mind state has a focal point that I cannot perceive?

Things I know I can't perceive:

* The force that initiates me, i.e. the force of my observation
* ???
