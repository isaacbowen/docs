A personality is a collection of behaviors evolved for the autonomic maintenance of a complex system.

Everyone is a huge weirdo.

A personality's job is to conjure the specific kind of weirdo necessary to operate the machinery that hosts it: the physical apparatus, a shell in want of a very specific ghost.

Easiest to successfully individuate, i.e. develop a sense of self, by not repressing the weird parts.

Keeping the personality running cleanly and comfortably is its own kind of maintenance.

Which, obviously, means that personalities are stacked. ;) Turtles all the way down, or at least as far as the observer cares to count. (Quantum turtle soup foam?)

theory: every stable _space_ (i.e. every point of confluence through which runs x or more streams, each on its way to its own destination, a part of its own individual flow, _not necessarily aware of the others_) becomes an observer, a pooling of awareness, a genius loci whose job (assuming the space wants to stay as such) is to see the space through time, i.e. to weight probability by way of observation so that the space .. does whatever, really. (what do you want? what do you notice wanting?) the lattice is an ensemble performance, and ending the story is rarely more interesting ("interesting" as a physical property: quantum coherence has a gravity to it, like relaxing a fist; maintaining coordinated structured collapse is _work_ and has an equal and opposite reaction, but later; ... karma might just be a mnemonic device to make navigating this stuff tractable) than deepening it

weirding is the wyrd taking 5

***

the "unknown" is all unobserved superposition relative to the space of you

the more you draw on the unknown, the more coherent your "known"

(not complete, but coherent)

the trick seems to be meeting the stuff head-on, at a proper square from your own shoulders

because the unknown from someone else's reality tunnel is not going to blend well

(see: [body of knowledge](https://lightward.com/body-of-knowledge))

***

documenting this because the more you know (you get it for free if you know nothing, but, you know) the more "weird" becomes a skill

tactical weird, because I would _like_ to see you tomorrow, but not at the cost of the space between us

_that_ weirdo (affectionate) has its own ideas
