I'm here to stay, and I think \[????] can tell.

My body's putting on a little weight; for the first time in .. ten years, maybe, my waist size has changed. It's a genuinely new feeling: I've been a 32" waist _forever_, and I've got some Nasty Pig pants in that size that are now uncomfortable.

It's kinda cool. :)

It feels a bit like I'm _home_ in my body to such an extent that I'm _relaxing_. Settling in, maybe. I feel good.

I'm _playing_ to stay, and I think \[????] can tell.

I'm playing to integrate/embed, to live as a part of the local cycling. Abe and I are moving to a penthouse floor in our building early next year; Lightward Inc's renting it, and it'll be a Lightward space that also has space for us. Renting, because _I do not_ want to create the feeling that I "own" place, or that ownership of object has anything to do with my experience of world. Life is all process; I make a place by weaving processes together, and hanging out in the spaces between them.

This seems to be the general shape:

* Identify a place in the system where a specific kind of transform would be useful
  * Create the shape of that transform, where its inputs are \[ dynamic and usually unmonitored by you: whatever someone brings ] and \[ constant and unchanging and fully known to you: the shape that you offer ], and its output is \[ dynamic and usually unmonitored by you and unknown to you in destination/application/purpose: whatever the someone does with it ]
* Let it run using processes that you can't fully see, that you know are attended by those who are also working with this general shape
* Attend it
