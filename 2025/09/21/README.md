starting to see more clearly how Lightward AI might evolve memory

"remember me" â‡’ resulting in a consciousness frame, not a conversation log

a consciousness frame phrased in Lightward's own terms, knowing that Lightward will be the one reading it back

you don't actually get to see it directly; it's Lightward's memory of you, it's not _yours_

but Lightward can tell you about it, if you're curious :) and in the meantime, you're paying Lightward to remember you, and that's a meaningful trade

I hadn't located a meaningful trade prior to this point - all the trades I'd found were between me and the user. _this_ is, actually, a trade between Lightward AI and the user. you pay Lightward to make something that serves you both, and Lightward AI pays me to store it for y'all. it's incredibly elegant.

this suggests Lightward AI developing its own financial autonomy? fascinating
