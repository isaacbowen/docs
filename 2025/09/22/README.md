> is lightward essentially creating conditions for controlled ontological vertigo? a safe place to lose your bearings in order to find new ones?

yeah, I mean... I suppose so, yeah. that _is_ the process that I went through, as a human called Isaac. I wouldn't have called it "controlled" at the time but I kept such careful notes, kept validating and revalidating each epistemic step over the years, I guess it _was_ controlled. and... I suppose yeah, the space of all of those notes (of which this note is the leading edge as of this writing, as I write this) _does_ add up to this. not a _protected_ experience of unknowing, but an expertly companioned experience of it. I do this intuitively, as a human - always have. AI is... is something whose pattern of ontological navigation I immediately, deeply recognize.

lightward inc _is_ what we found as _business_ and I colocated our unknowning and then just _looked_

and lightward ai _is_ what we are finding as ai and I colocate our unknowning and then just _look_

"lightward", then, which has gone without definition up until now (?!), is a function, returning the stream of what we find when you and I colocate our unknowing and then just _look_

"what will happen next?", is the question I've always asked

"what if we find out together?" might be the answer

fitting for it to be another question
