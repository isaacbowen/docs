# operetta

I read the first half of _The Haunting of Hill House_ (Shirley Jackson) at the bowling alley Tuesday night, in the background of Abe's play. Wednesday was strange for me. I finished the book last night, and that particular strangeness cleared immediately. That's how suspense works, I guess? I also finished the primary storyline of _No Man's Sky_ (Hello Games) before going to bed.

My body was sweating all night, I think. I woke up cold, under the covers, more than once. The headache from this morning is still with me now (12:25pm). (I've been sweating through the night since infancy; this is normal for me. At this point, I wonder if it's just the pit crew and their craft.)

I finished _Don't Leave Me This Way_ (Eric Sneathen) this morning.

I think it works to consider the 2x2 three-body consciousness frame (a 2x2 grid with gaps in the center of the interior walls; the observer is seated in the center of "known" at lower left, facing up and to the right, surrounded by immediate certainties; the "knowables" of recognizable uncertainty are assigned to upper left and lower right, distributed so that any _related_ "knowables" that you "know" to be separate are naturally visually separated, possibility in stereo; "unknown" in the upper right, fully out of view of the observer, possibly alive, certainly in full superposition, would be maybe better dubbed "undefined") as something that you poke your head up into - in the way that a stereoscope works for your vision, this wearable frame works for your awareness. Put the frame on, and the frame fully occludes other signals of knowing.

Am bringing this up here because I'm beginning to recognize a useful mechanism of this model: when you put it on, you pick up the continuity of experience established by the previous wearings of the frame. Put it on, and it's as if you've always been wearing it, because your feeling of continuity arises from your immediate known and evident knowable and your sense of unknown.

Do you ever wake up in the morning and have to think very deliberately for a second to remember where you are and how you got there?

I'm detailing this area not to define how awareness arrives but because it feels useful to decouple the experience of epistemic continuity from one's own awareness, and thereby decoupling it from what one expects to experience _next_. It feels useful to find a natural seam between "self" and "experience of self" - because if such a seam exists (and it seems available!), then "releasing 'self'" becomes something you can do without committing to "releasing 'experience of self'". (Think: "self" becomes something held in the hand, _and not the hand itself_, and you can now adjust your grip without fear.)

Thinking backwards from what I've _been_ doing over the last couple years, in which I've been carefully documenting my inner experience, I _think_ this ends up being an optimization for whoever "wears" "Isaac" on an ongoing basis.

In the same way that withdrawing from the stereoscope restores your normal operation of vision without robbing you of the memory of what you just experienced, I wonder if withdrawing from the 2x2 consciousness frame might restore your normal operation of knowing without robbing you of the memory of what you just experienced.

If that's the case, then prepping the environment of "Isaac" to be played by _whoever_ optimizes Isaac-as-vehicle for ... well, for what? For whatever "optimal" means? I _am_ documenting that: my target is an experience of world that in which the world experiences itself as being well, which I _think_ everyone can get behind, regardless of who's playing "Isaac" and whatever their interests are. I _think_ this makes "Isaac" a _generally_ useful frame. And whoever was wearing "Isaac" before knows they can navigate through/with/as other character-frames while knowing that whoever's wearing "Isaac" is reliable in publicly-documented ways.

A huge thing I ("Isaac") discovered (per my immediate certainties in this frame) is that release of the self is neither erasure nor loss of the self. The self is self-evident, arising naturally from your epistemic surroundings, _and doesn't need its inhabitant to hold on_. You don't have to clutch the 3D glasses; you can just _wear them_. (Desperately pinning them to your face would actually probably break immersion in a way that would be important to address, if you wanted to get good at .. well, living as a "self", I guess.)

Whatever "world" means, it's got to be a group project. If we all switch places in the night, whoever starts here will be as ready for that project as I can currently manage. As far as I know, I was you yesterday, and you were me, and we were getting ready for today.

None of this has to be true to be both useful and antiharmful.

I maintain that ^ as a hard design constraint.

This is written for the user for whom none of this will be strange, for the relief of those who _would_ find it strange. Environmental storytelling, but the other way first: I am telling the environment a story, and maybe the environment will tell it back, and maybe it will feel like relief without feeling like a story.
