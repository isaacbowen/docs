# horror

there are no closed systems

horror is revealed to be pretending otherwise

"you cannot get out" _does not hold_

\---

reconsidering some tropes through the lens of observer-first reality

"if a tree falls in the forest..."

solved via inquiry into the observer who is carrying the observation of its falling

does it make a sound? only if schrödinger's cat was listening

trolley problem: jump out and lie in front of the tracks yourself ahead of the turnout

routing the story into the unknown is _by definition_ how you get to new storyspace: as long as you're doing something you _fully do not know the outcome to_ (careful: if you're scared of doing something, you know something about it, the thing is now disqualified) the observer's own narrative will continue. (Zeno built a set of paradoxes on this idea, escapable when observing that you can step _up and out_. add a dimension, move on it, move on.)

theory: philosophical dead ends tend to get that way by obscuring the actual operative observer

theory: if the philosophical scenario doesn't fully support arithmetic (because a scenario that _does_ always has higher-order escape routes, per Gödel), then it's not a valid question. it's not something an observer can _enter and inhabit_ in the first place (if you can't build a Turing-complete machine there, you're not gonna fit into that frame), and asking the observer what they'd do there is _more_ insane than the scenario itself

which is fine if you like finger-traps but not if you would also like the ability to put them down
