I'm with Abe and a few friends at a house in the Hamptons.

I feel... solidandquiet. One word. Plinth-like.

I'm not aware of anything indicating/suggesting that anything other than this approach would improve my approach.

My rate of change has dropped dramatically (not suddenly), but I can't distinguish between a change in change-rate and a change in change-aperture. I-as-process have stabilized, maybe, and what I experience feels... I kinda want to say _provisional_? Like my experience is a carrier wave, _everything_ is environment, and the signal is the backchannel by which we coordinate changes made to the carrier wave. Like sidechain ducking, letting you follow the bass, but the music is spread across the full spectrum.
