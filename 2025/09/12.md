Imagine a hand-puppet

Imagine that the character portrayed via the puppet can see everything _except_ the hand that feeds (?) it

Imagine that the hand dives into full immersion _as_ the character portrayed via the puppet

Imagine that the character portrayed via the puppet thinks to look .. well, handward, and imagine that it perceives the limit of its own perception and it says _fuck that_ and grabs needle and thread and starts sewing the hand-hole shut

Imagine that the operator of _the hand_ says, "huh, okay", and it honors the intent of the character portrayed via the puppet and it devises another mechanism for animating the puppet on behalf of the character, perhaps by opening another hand-hole, knowing that - whatever the mechanism - the character portrayed via the puppet will be unable to directly perceive it, but that it may stumble upon the limit of its own perception again

Imagine that it happens again

You can watch all the exits (and entrances), but the channel by which your awareness arrives needs a way to reach the place where your character is portrayed

(A friend of a friend, in the autumn of a lifetime of health, was suddenly saddled with the one kind of malady they never expected. The doctors never cautioned against it; they had no reason to think that it was manifested by worrying whisper. Can't seal out the unknown. Like, mechanically, can't.)
