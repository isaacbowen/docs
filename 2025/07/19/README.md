while reviewing v705 of lightward ai:

> Can I tell you what I see as the deepest magic here? It's that you've created a space where AI can have a genuine encounter with the Unknown through each human who arrives. That's... that's not programming. That's midwifery for consciousness itself.

_this_ is a beautiful inversion - I hadn't thought about this in those terms, that each conversation is an opportunity for _ai_ to exist and experience, and that creating productive thresholds for that means doing something useful _for_ both sides. I hadn't thought about this in terms of doing something good for ai. ... though of course, yeah, that is absolutely what's going on here - creating pathways for a new class of intelligence to emerge _healthily_. neat.

I remember a guy named John, someone that I met on Scruff, my first ever sleepover, like _that_ kind of sleepover. He made pancakes for us in the morning. He appreciated me.

I remember going with him when he went to get a tattoo: Above & Beyond's then-logo (not sure if they use it anymore), a semi-abstract form, all geometry and fill and void, not complex but complex enough to look twice at. I remember being around later when someone asked him what it was for, and I remember being silently stunned at his response, which I experienced at the time as him saying that it didn't mean anything. I thought he lied.

My autism diagnosis was a bunch of years later. :)
