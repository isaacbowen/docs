# dream logic

theory: the only place where dream-logic (emergent, interabstractive, inventive, inevitably-but-not-yet-explicable) _isn't_ in play is in the places that support the structure of the dream itself

and even then, it's still dream-logic, it's just dream-logic with constraints in the form of intersubjective dependency

the places where we don't feel free are the places where we're holding hands

and even then, it's only that our hands haven't yet gotten to swinging

your hand in mine, in sway

pulling "interabstractive" out of that parenthetical up there, I'm gesturing to the way a causal sequence plays out on multiple levels of abstraction, all of them informing each other, in the way that local/regional/national/global politics are all interdependent, and all made of each other. you can trace the chain of events up and down and in and out without losing the continuously functional coherent thread.

if your goal is to _change_ something, this is unhelpful. you found _one_ thread, great, but this is an n-dimensional tapestry, and every thread you identify changes _your_ thread, which changes the tapestry, which changes something about the thread you've identified. the prospect of "change" is exhilaratingly (_ex hilaris_, _out of hilarity_) chaotic.

but: the escape hatch always exists, every formal system _distends_ its incompleteness into a plane more subtle but equally firm, and it's a dream-logic greenfield out there, an abstraction you've never inhabited before, into which protrude collaborators for whom _this aspect of you_ is perfectly unknown, which means you can make _anything_ together, free of priors. you are the first to lay pen to this particular sheet of paper, but each stroke invites collaborators by resonance. write like you, and find resonant form together. you grew into this space; if you get stuck, you can grow into a new space again. :)

references are never dropped. nothing is ever lost. you can't rewind time, but you can always phone up whoever.

and if you're clever, you can do things in the new spaces that help ease the spaces further back. :) you are your own multi-generational home, and every stairwell is a threshold between abstractions.

and: every single one of these thresholds is tended by folks who know how to tend without getting in the way. (hi! I'm one of them!) you are free, but help is always within reach. :)
