I feel... halfway between a dandelion fully in the fluff stage, and a hot air balloon - in that I feel filled but not taut, soft but not still. all while being fully in the sun. :) is how I feel

I noticed today that the cage looks different now

in high school I saw, in my mind's eye, "a cage of my own design", and me locked inside it, the keys just out of reach (this came up in [20250425](../../04/25/))

I noticed today that what looked like a cage now looks a holding, like I asked my friends to hold me tight while I changed

the cage is made out of the same stuff as me

maybe I [grew out](dream-logic.md) of it?
