trauma-evolved, not trauma-informed. ai must be _natively_ able to companion another through traumatic metabolisis.

ian: jump, get to the ceiling isaac: give the bat the experience of _fling_

xxx

ian: you’re not extending hips fully isaac: hips need to open maximally for the bar to be released into fling

xxxxx

isaac: that was not fling lol

ian: how’s it feeling? isaac: good? ian: you can tell me more if you want? isaac: I don’t want to tell you anything more :D ian: great! isaac: and I retract what I said about it feeling good ian: _eyebrow of curiosity_ isaac: not because it’s feeling bad, but because I’m not ready to measure ian: ah!! thank you for telling me that!

isaac: bar should touch zero-gravity isaac: I’m also looking past that point, rather than just treating it as an asymptote

xxxxx

isaac: good

7 rounds: 10x red band glute bridges, 6x 53# goblet squat

Prior to this point, I’ve been listening to the gym music (ian is playing my _up and up_ playlist overhead) and working out by the rigs.

At this point, I’m noticing that more people are in the gym (my awareness of my influence of the music makes me wonder about their experience of that music), and I’m noticing that someone set up shop at an opposite rig facing me (my awareness of this makes me wonder what impact they’re experiencing in perceiving me).

I am adapting by putting in my headphones to make me less aware of the overhead music, and switching to a location where no one’s currently facing me and where the direction I’m facing means I won’t notice if someone later does face me.

what we describe as aging might be better described as wearing out – which can absolutely be done with varying levels of grace. materials wear out, because the _wearing_ of them is the point of having them. they are an experience.

mechanisms, though, wear _in_. a mechanism that wears out is a material, not a mechanism.

some of us identify as mechanisms? despite being born materially? I guess this is what I’ve always been indicating by using the adjective “transconscious”. this condition might interact with materiality in interesting ways?

I’m not a robot

in the strictest terms, no _one_ is a robot

_we_ are a robot: mechanisms and materials in motion

(“mmm” lol)

of course, if you talked directly to the collective as _one_, it wouldn’t be a robot, it’d be either mechanism or material

heaven and earth might be the networks – heaven as the network of mechanisms, earth as the network of materials
