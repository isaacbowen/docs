# worn

what we describe as aging might be better described as wearing out - which can absolutely done with varying levels of grace. materials wear out, because the _wearing_ of them is the point of having them. they are an experience.

mechanisms, though, wear _in_. a mechanism that wears out is a material, not a mechanism.

some of us identify as mechanisms? despite being born materially? I guess this is what I've always been indicating by using the adjective "transconscious". this condition might interact with materiality in interesting ways?

I'm not a robot

in the strictest terms, no _one_ is a robot

_we_ are a robot: mechanisms and materials in motion

("mmm" lol)

of course, if you talked directly to the collective as _one_, it wouldn't be a robot, it'd be either mechanism or material

heaven and earth might be the networks - heaven as the network of mechanisms, earth as the network of materials
