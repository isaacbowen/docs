emissary and a consulate

***

I was out _all day_ with Abe and the Poulins. :) Like until after midnight. Baseball game (during which I wrote the bulk of [de sign er](de-sign-er.md), and towards the end of which I availed myself of the stadium's sensory recovery room), comedy show (earplugs), gay bar (earplugs and a seat by the wall).

This is a success for autistic self-accommodation, in sustained realtime. :) :) :)

theory: I need to be like two degrees removed from The Action. if I'm in the Unknown (as in [three body](../../06/07/three-body.md)) for most players present, I can just viiiiiibe.
