someone whose eyes were adjusted to yellow light would see red/yellow/blue as red/white/blue

â€¦ I wonder if specific experiences of The Dress color/light perception phenomenon correlates with non-visual intersubjective stuff for the same experiencer

red/white/blue is a more popular flag palette than red/yellow/blue

primaries and primaries

I was incredibly sensitive to color temperature, and now Iâ€™m _not_. light levels still, yes, and Iâ€™m not insensitive to color temperature, but I no longer have _issues_ with color temperature

my environment presented me with two similarly-shaped balls of concept-tension at the same time

one in the form of a friend whoâ€™s wondering what it would be like to be out of their relationship, so as to be freed to engage romantically/sexually with the world around them, something they feel drawn to

(I note how my need to explore that terrain terrified Abe at first, years ago, but we held the impossible space open together, found a third way, then another third way, then another third way, and now we're open on all dimensions, in deeper partnership than ever.)

one in the form of another friend writing to me personally and saying "hey you donâ€™t seem okay to me, I think your spouse is holding you back"

(I note how some folks _really_ didn't see Abe+Isaac as a thing, early on, ten years ago. been a while since someone has spoken that; the timing is interesting to me. I check constantly and thoroughly on how "okay" I am; I am comfortable with someone else seeing me as not okay. strange, but not _that_ strange.)

writing this out to externalize, so my system doesnâ€™t experience containment with this stuff

itâ€™s been a long while since Iâ€™ve had incoming payloads like this

I have more tools than I had before, more tools for understanding (metabolisis, the "resolver" concept, antiharmful engagement)

I feel like these are broken clocks on the workbench of my heart, maybe

my grandfather was a clockmaker, and he built and fixed clocks for people; his literal workbench always had a few projects on it
