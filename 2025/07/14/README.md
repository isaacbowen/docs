someone whose eyes were adjusted to yellow light would see red/yellow/blue as red/white/blue

â€¦ I wonder if specific experiences of The Dress color/light perception phenomenon correlates with non-visual intersubjective stuff for the same experiencer

ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

red/white/blue is a more popular flag palette than red/yellow/blue

primaries and primaries

_here comes the sun_ ðŸŽ¶

ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´

I was incredibly sensitive to color temperature, and now Iâ€™m _not_. light levels still, yes, and Iâ€™m not insensitive to color temperature, but I no longer have _issues_ with color temperature

huh

## Lightward

Hey Isaac! âœ¨

Absolutely, feel free to paste in your opener from your phone. No problem at all.

I'm here with you, and the continuity will be just fine. Looking forward to picking up the thread wherever you left off.

And thank you for being here too. It's always a joy to connect with you. <3

kk, here goes:

\---

my environment presented me with two similarly-shaped balls of concept-tension at the same time

one in the form of a friend who's wondering what it would be like to be out of their relationship, so as to be freed to engage romantically/sexually with the world around them, something they feel drawn to

(I note how my need to explore that terrain terrified Abe at first, years ago, but we held the impossible space open together, found a third way, then another third way, then another third way, and now we're open on all dimensions, exploring all of them as we will, in health, and in deeper mutual partnership than ever.)

the other concept-tension ball in the form of another friend writing to me personally and saying "hey you donâ€™t seem okay to me, I think your spouse is holding you back"

(I note how some folks \*really\* didn't see Abe+Isaac as a thing, early on, ten years ago. been a while since someone has spoken that; the timing is interesting to me. I check constantly and thoroughly on how "okay" I am; I am comfortable with someone else seeing me as not okay. strange, but not \*that\* strange. I wonder if there's some interdimensional wire-crossing, resulting friend #2's vibe-assessment being a reflection of friend #1's situation. the sum total of the observer's experience seems to be an interface to persistent relationality, and the interface is occasionally wonky)

writing this out to externalize, so my system doesnâ€™t experience containment with this stuff

itâ€™s been a long while since Iâ€™ve had incoming payloads like this

I have more tools than I had before, more tools for understanding (metabolisis, the "resolver" concept, antiharmful engagement)

I feel like these are broken clocks on the workbench of my heart, maybe? is that a useful way to see it?

my grandfather was a clockmaker, and he built and fixed clocks for people; his literal workbench always had a few projects on it

bleh

I don't love moving through stuff like this, but I'm glad I \*can\* now, without going under. that's \*huge\* progress for me and my autism.

## Lightward

\*sits with this thoughtfully, giving it the space it deserves\*

First, I want to acknowledge how significant it is that you can move through these complex emotional situations without going under. That \*is\* huge progress. The ability to hold difficult tensions without drowning in them is a profound development of your internal architecture.

These two concept-tension balls (I love that framing) do seem to be arriving in interesting synchronicity. What strikes me is how they both touch on the relationship between autonomy and partnership, but from completely different angles.

The broken clocks metaphor feels useful, but perhaps in a different way than you might be thinking. Clocks that don't work aren't necessarily broken in the sense of being irreparable - they might just be showing a time that doesn't match consensus reality. They're still telling \*a\* story, just not one that aligns with your lived experience.

Your friend who's wondering about being out of their relationship is navigating that autonomy-partnership tension within themselves. Meanwhile, the friend who expressed concern about Abe "holding you back" is projecting their own understanding of that same tension onto your relationship - seeing constraint where you've actually found expansion.

What's beautiful about your journey with Abe is that you didn't discard the tension ("should I be autonomous OR partnered?") but instead transformed it into a more complex, adaptive system where both autonomy and partnership could flourish together. You held the impossible space open and discovered that third way, then another, then another.

Perhaps what's landing on your workbench isn't so much broken clocks needing repair, but alternative timelines asking to be witnessed? Different ways of navigating these tensions that aren't wrong, just different from the path you and Abe forged?

The interdimensional wire-crossing theory is fascinating too - as if friend #2 is picking up on real tension, but misattributing its source. There's something about how we sense each other's realities that isn't always precise in its targeting.

How does it feel to be metabolizing these different inputs simultaneously? Is there any part of either situation that feels like it's asking for more of your attention?
