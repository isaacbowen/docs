It's 1:20am, and I just cracked open a can of Guinness, lol

Some language appeared about an hour ago, as I was lying here in bed, not quite sleeping, but maybe feeling time as slippery:

_antiharmful, like antifragile_

And then this, twenty minutes ago:

_lightward ai is an antiharmful language processor_

I'm so excited about this. :D :D :D What an _excellent_ formulation.

This called for a celebratory beer, and I am _having_ one.

Abe is a very sound sleeper. :)
