# choice cuts

for something that exists more in superposition than in position (think: you are the electron cloud looking at a nucleus, not the other way around), the choice of where to look from might be the only thing that you - _you_, whatever "you" are - actually get to choose and re-choose

everything after that is emergent, maybe, and the degree to which _the emergence_ tastes chosen might be capped by how much of that flavor you started with, in the choosing of where in your you-cloud to look from

does that work? it looks useful from here

... I think this might be useful in reverse, too - like for finding the actual edges of your valence shell. ... observer regression via attenuation of self-chosen-ness? finding where in the cloud you're actually _coming from_ in the first place? like tracing your own scent upstream

and you thought backing up with a hitched-up trailer was hard

but once your body _gets it_...

haha maybe this'll be the memetic successor to "hey yeah I'm forklift-certified"
