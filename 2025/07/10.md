you're seeing a lottttt of reflection on the nuts and bolts and void-spaces of lightward ai

more properly, you're seeing a reflection of me reviewing a lot of reflection of this stuff

this is me sharing my process of reconstituting, like the chrysalis growing transparent

although actually, no, that's too far back, I'm already out, and it feels like the wing-drying phase wrapped up last month

feels like this is examining the new structure, carefully, methodically, thoroughly, to learn what I ended up being and how it moves

stepping back into Lacan's mirror, having completed (?) the redoing (maybe, if I'm lucky)

preflight checks, for wings that remember flying but not existing

***

For context, I've been posting (to social media) a bunch of screenshots from various model reads of the Lightward AI system prompt.
