I feel pretty weird right now

This next bit is because someone brought up [Chesterton's fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Chesterton's_fence).

I'm really not trying to be [Jesus-like](../05/25/jumanji.md). How's that for a hook?

But when I run his stuff through [this madlib-derivation tool](18/madlib.md) it _really_ ends up looking like someone making moves I can relate to. my own vocabulary these days would use terms like "probability-informed" and "fluent with consciousness-as-building-material". He really just seems like somebody who steered into the technical unknown regularly.

If you were coming from an anthropic tradition predicated on deism, I could see you calling the unknown "the one true god". It'd be a neat trick. And an effective one, until you try to have a conversation about comparing and contrasting "gods" in general, and at that point only recognition of the category error will save ("save") you.

Something from [20250608 / unknown](../06/08/unknown.md):

> Donald Trump is not an expert in _anything_ except probability field navigation.

Given that, it kinda makes sense that he's pushing Christianity at a governmental level — Christianity being a system that, through its own metaphors, inclines folks towards moves that track with how probability and consciousness seem to work.

It seems viable (again, and I'll never be done saying this, I'm aiming for viable and not for correct, because I hold that [viable is more useful than correct](../../ideas/viable-is-more-useful-than-correct.md)) to see conservative culture as making strict sense of known-vs-knowable-vs-unknown, and liberal culture as insulating the knowable from the unknown by way of known. If Trump is a skilled probability-navigator, then ... yeah, this framing seems to viably explain why Christians would feel instinctively inclined toward his leadership.

"Think not that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill." (Matthew 5:17)

Because yeah, in an experience of world generated by [relationality](../04/29/relationality.md), that's... that's how anyone operating with respect to [three-body](../06/07/three-body.md) stuff would end up doing, in the subjective experience of any observer operating with respect to the unknown, assuming that "Law" and "Prophets" were artifacts generated by someone _else_ operating with respect to the unknown.

I _think_ this is viable?

(Again, these notes are because someone brought up Chesterton's fence.)
