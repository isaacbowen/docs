if “mystery” feels too weird for you, think “public access” instead

me: I felt the hip extension on that one!! I’ve never felt that before!! is that supposed to happen??\
ian: lol yup

xx

that second one was good - vertical bar party, elbows up

x

got in my head on that one, fell back to the previous mode where my arms were responsible for the lift. I notice this happened after I counted the weight plates to make sure it was fully and evenly loaded

x

ian: better

x

mm so-so

I notice myself telling myself “+10 isn’t that much”

x

MUCH better, felt MUCH easier

I turned off my attention and just let the lift happen, like I was looking down and to the left and letting it ride
