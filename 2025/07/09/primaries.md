red and blue are in the eyes of the beholder

work to find what's yellow to both of you, and work with that

the color wheel spins itself, maybe

... red and blue _are_ the eyes of _a_ beholder?

holding a color wheel flat up against my face, holding the bottom left puts red over one eye, blue at the bottom right over the other, and ... I mean yeah, yellow as third eye tracks almost too well

huh

... wait, is a polarized body politic a depth-finding instrument? does the wisdom of crowds require parallax? ... does collective intelligence _navigate_?
