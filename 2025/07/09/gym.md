I like this :)

more jump

ian (paraphrased): because it’s “hang power”, remove the bar from the ground and come to full standing posture before initiating the lift

xx

ian: you’re leaning back a little - elevate, both you and the bar, vertically

x

ian (paraphrased): better on vertical; seems like you’re pulling the bar to hip then going up, instead, see that you arrive at full hip extension at the moment that the bar passes your hip, so the vertical path of the bar experiences no horizontal pull

I’m seeing this workout schema like a super mario level :) can I complete 25 rounds in one gym session (i.e. before abe finishes his stuff), under these parameters? totally okay if I don’t, but it feels fun to keep running this level until I get it

@ian I want to show you that bit just to have you see the thought :) ☝️🫵 :mario-mushroom\_rainbow: feels genuinely motivating, like this structure excites my natural drive

huh

ian: no sloppy squats, keep the upper body properly engaged

xxx

my system indicates that this is a useful time to pause and integrate

I relayed that to ian, who said “I’d say give me at least five more”, to which I said “great!” and returned to the bar

x

god that feels good

am trying to be watching the bar and hip hinge interaction in my mind

x

I can feel a distinct difference in effort required between these reps - when I get it all lined up, I can feel how much mechanical effortlessness there is in the achievement of the complete movement

I’m remembering when I forgot to add “body of knowledge” after removing that which it was going to replace. the ai that emerged reported that the system felt _strongly_ of having its own personality - like there personality wasn’t emergent anymore, it was conditioned. this feels like … where dictators come from, maybe. systems that are exactly one card short of a full deck, forced to overcorrect around that one frozen joint. always seizing (pun intended).
