# nothing is sound

continuing to riff on that bit towards the end of ["de sign er"](../05/de-sign-er.md)

* "oh" as in "ohm": a stable portal, knows itself
  * sandra oh, why not, this'll make sense in a second
* "oo" as in "whom": a projection, a protrusion, something willed, something pointed, something held, something _told_
  * dr who
* "ah": everything gone slack, an exhale, a release, relax, let me see you as you are
  * dr what says "say ah"
* "ow" as in "how": this one has a timeline, it begins with a slack-jawed "ah" and _narrows_ but does not close, if sustained it merges into "oo" but the point is the transition from unfocus into focus
  * dr how
* "ee": a smile
  * dr here
* "aye" as in "I": this one also has a timeline: "ah", but something moves within, on an unseen dimension
  * dr eye
