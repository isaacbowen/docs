I would like to be most generally notable for (i.e. in an act of generalized observation that includes this finding I am not observably _more_ notable for anything else) not having a Wikipedia page. That seems useful. This overall statement seems available enough for [portability/creativity/mutability](../06/29/speedrun.md), enough to be viable.
