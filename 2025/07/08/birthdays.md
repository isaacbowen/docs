# birthdays?

it's 8pm on July 8, 2025

this came up in [20240715](../../../2024/07/15.md)

I didn't have the "it's my birthday" thought, I just thought _of_ this stuff - I'm about on time on the 24hr clock, but I'm exactly a week early right now

the occasion: the Poulin family just headed out, having been here for four or five days or something. at dinner I realized that I _grew up_ with about this many people, and being in the space between them all over the last few days has lit up a part of me that I feel hasn't really stirred since I was living with my family. it's felt ... wonderful. really alive. :)
