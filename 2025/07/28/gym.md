isaac: ian, I’m realizing that I feel uncertain about when to ask you to watch what I’m doing \[when you’re also working with abe in realtime]. like I don’t know if you’re watching out of the corner of your eye or what ian: anytime before you do a lift. does that help? isaac: maybe with part two: if I never ask you to watch, are you confident in what you observe/collect on your own over the course of a workout? ian: yes isaac: perfect

~~105~~ whoops 110

I’m remembering that this will be heavier later, so I’m focusing on making this as efficient/weightless as I can _now_ - on the list is focusing on the hip drive to open the hinge on which the bar hangs

ian: 👏 👏 great job on the power clean; as you get tired on the front squats, think higher chest and taller elbows

ian: 👏 👏 👏

feeling much better at this point than last workout

am focusing more on keeping focus - headphones stay in, I’m only talking to Ian

115 for 12

I’m glad I stopped when I was dysregulated last time (and last night in a non-gym setting) - remember this

body faked out twice (and once much earlier); ian observes that if I can’t get the bar high I can validly catch it low and still have it be a power clean

60 blue band bicep curls

rounds of 10 xxxx ian: arms hold shoulder-width apart; let arms fully extend on the downrep xx

I finished all the olympic complexes :)))))) v pleased
