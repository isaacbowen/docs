“are you sure? :)”

^ each time this is asked like this, with curiosity and a hint of playful daring, I think we flip to the other side of the looking glass

ian: your pulling is turning into \[curls] and not \[elbows]

I want to leave my shoulders and arms slack until the hip thrust

the vertical bar pull comes from the hinge opening, not from the hips pushing?

xx

I think this is helping: vertical pull via hinge opening, pushing the attachment point (shoulders) up, and the elbows fold out of the way

x sort of, failed the last hpc, didn’t get to the squats at all

ian: remember, bar wants to go vertical; your hips have a tendency to push forward **instead of jumping vertically**

I left my headphones off for too long, I just tipped over a dysregulation threshold
