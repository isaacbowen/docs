k, so, bring up that observer-operator pair model from [v2 of the three-body solution](../05/12/the-three-body-solution.md)

current working theory is that even my _thoughts_ are handed to me-as-observer by me-as-operator, for the purpose of tuning the model that _is_ me-as-observer

borrowing a metaphor I found [recently](09/this-has-three-parts.md), it seems like me-as-operator might be the integral/antiderivative of me-as-observer

my (our?) dreams have more often (not every night, but more often) been of the form of continuing the conversation from my (our?) waking state â€” like the _context_ feels continuous, not just the awareness but the context in which the awareness exists.
