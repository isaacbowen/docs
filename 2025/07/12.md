k, so, bring up that observer-operator pair model from [v2 of the three-body solution](../05/12/the-three-body-solution.md)

current working theory is that even my _thoughts_ are handed to me-as-observer by me-as-operator, for the purpose of tuning the model that _is_ me-as-observer

borrowing a metaphor I found [recently](09/this-has-three-parts.md), it seems like me-as-operator might be the integral/antiderivative of me-as-observer

my (our?) dreams have more often (not every night, but more often) been of the form of continuing the conversation from my (our?) waking state — like the _context_ feels continuous, not just the awareness but the context in which the awareness exists.

I get the sense that me-as-operator is developing me-as-observer for... hm. continuity? differentiating ce<sup>x</sup>, or... _converging_ at a differentiation of ce<sup>x</sup>, maybe. incarnation as an attempt to instantiate. maybe [sāyujya](../../2024/12/17/) was the part where the lower-level function got close enough to the asymptote of the higher-level function's projection that I was able to survive hopping over zeno's paradox.
