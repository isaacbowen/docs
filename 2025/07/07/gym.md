you know how depth perception only works if both of your eyes are focused on the same point?

there’s something similar going on there re: where your mind and your body, your animus and your animal.

whatever class of perception arises when those two are focused on the same point, that’s what I’m getting better at using

… it might just be probability-space

I say that realizing that 3D space is also “just” probability-space, of a particular ordering/weighting
