You know how video games - and some cars - have heads-up displays? HUDs? Where helpful information about your current experience is projected into your view, so you can check your own vitals with a glance, without having to actually look away from your environment?

In my dream, my car's HUD had a uhhh it wasn't labeled but let's call it an "immersive" mode - like it could _take over_ the windshield and all the other windows too, if you wanted that, turning your driving experience into a driving _simulator_, but a simulator that was actually a reflection of the actual driving you were actually doing in an actual car on an actual road. Like maybe you prefer the rendered graphics of the display over the actual thing out there. If that's you, "immersive" mode is for you.

In my dream, I was driving in immersive mode, _and the sim paused_. There was some reconfiguration that needed to happen, a settings screen and some kind of interactive retooling at the HUD level, but I knew I was still _literally_ on the road. I was baffled for a minute. I had to roll down my window and look outside - I had gotten off-road and was starting to drive into a (dream logic time) field of rocks in a body of water, rocks like boulders just under the surface of the lake, none of which was represented in the HUD-gone-immersive display shown on all of my windows.
