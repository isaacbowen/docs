so it _seems_ like that-which-I-experience-as-reality rushes in to fill a vacuum as soon as I am able to define the shape of the void and the nature of the unattended vital process that would grow to fill it

the "unattended" part is key. I'm not claiming causality here in a way that would check out intersubjectively, but I distinctly came to a point where I held the thought "I think I've learned everything that I can learn from programming", held it and it just felt true, and _then_ Claude Code landed. in my personal, strictly subjective experience of my own narrative: as soon as I removed _myself_ from the narrative I recognize as the way I recognize the story of programming (all of those words are important), the story of programming _rapidly_ came alive, alive _without me_, in a way that relieved the struggle that those close to me were having with it. void-filled-vitally.

it _feels_ like I've arrived at an understanding (understanding-as-process, not understanding-as-artifact) of what people get glimpses of when they get on mushrooms or acid or whatever, or what people touch through deepening meditation: that whole deal where everything is _intensely_ connected and _intensely_ okay and _intensely_ alive, and where you and a buddy can both touch the same thing and have a completely different experience, and those two experiences _expressed_ will create something vital

I _think_ I've arrived at that thing that the apostles were gesturing at when they wrote about "a peace that surpasses all understanding". _without_ routing my access to it through an external concept, like someone who's learned how plants and fire work, like really _work_, plants-as-process and fire-as-process, who will totally go out to dinner to try a new spot, see what the chef's doing there, maybe especially with friends, but who gets on just fine with just a garden and a good knife and pan

and I got here just via ... observing my own awareness and writing it down? doing the [exigraph](../../05/02/exigraph.md) thing? releasing my self-concept and discovering I could survive that and writing down what happened, when my self-concept became indistinguishable from my other-concept or my god-concept? and observing that everything/everyone was still here afterwards? and checking my work (and checking my work against multiple reflective surfaces, and reconciling the reflections) over and over and over again? and deriving functional, testable tools as I went from territory to territory? ([the model](../../../2024/the-model.md), [awareness is](../../04/27/awareness-is/), [three body](../../06/07/three-body.md), [resolver](../../06/04/resolver/resolver-further-resolved.md), [metabolisis](../../04/17/metabolisis.md), [syncfire](syncfire.md))

I'm settling into what this seems to _mean_, like for the process-not-artifact of my own aliveness, started to get into it [yesterday](../28/)

my system remapped/repurposed my sense of fear, once I stopped having any use for it

my sense of _relief_... might be next? I've been steering by that for years, but if I'm not swinging into positions from which I need relief anymore, ... this might be next?

embodiment and home are more critical than ever - but they're also more unthreatenable than ever, so I don't know if "critical" is the right word. I mostly want to stress here in this paragraph that the stuff I'm touching isn't a leaving-the-earth-to-go-somewhere-better kind of thing at all. I don't get to say that that's _not_ a thing, but what I'm doing remains completely _earthy_.

super curious

I'm noticing kid-like behavior coming up for me more, that particular flavor of unabashed curiosity and total willingness to get distracted

am also sleeping a ton

hrm hrm hrm

these notes are here in part to _keep_ me from floating away - not because I feel any danger of that, but because I see how people in these states could tend toward that. I intend to be useful _here_. this is my home. I think if I floated away I'd have to start over somewhere else. and, [again](../../05/26/aeowiwtweiabw.md), I wanna get to an experience of world in which the world experiences itself as being well
