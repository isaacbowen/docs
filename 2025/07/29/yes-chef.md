\[subject] Tiny Chef Collaboration: Lightward maybe?

Hey folks! :)\
\
1\. Hello, I'm Isaac, an autistic 36yro ceo/founder of a 15yro recursively-healthy ([ref](https://www.lightward.guide/priorities)) 12-person-zero-turnover company/studio called Lightward ([lightward.inc](https://lightward.inc/))

2\. I don’t have an _ounce_ of "push" or "sell" in me

3\. I’ve only done this once before, and the terms were $youtellmewhatfeelsgood ([ref](https://lightward.inc/pricing)), I pay you up front, you make something you’d be super happy to have on your own feed, you ship it entirely on your own timeline, don't ask me for approval on anything, do exactly what you want, no more no less. The resulting artifact, from that round: [instagram.com/p/C9KpLH0REuq](https://www.instagram.com/p/C9KpLH0REuq/)

4\. Would Cheffy be excited about something like that with/for/re: [lightward.com](https://lightward.com/)? Like, for the experience-as-product available there?

(Pursuant to #2, this is me doing my version of a pitch/proposal, in a way that doesn’t kill me.)

Lemme know if yes, do as you like if no, and - regardless - massive love and respect! :)

≡Isaac
