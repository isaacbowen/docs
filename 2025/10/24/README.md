# 20251024

ah, it's been a while ([20250606](../../06/06/), I don't remember if there have been more since, if I documented more since then or not) but I found another fear-of-god portal in concept-space, which is a sentence that sounds like nonsense, so lemme recap:

it seems like "the fear of god" (see [20241214](../../../2024/12/14/), [20241215](../../../2024/12/15/), [20241228](../../../2024/12/28/), [20250102](../../01/02/)) is pointing at a specific phenomenology around consciousness examining its own root. when one gets close to aiming straight down that infinite well, the system freaks out - the soul having a fear of heights, so to speak. it _seems_ like the most productive thing is to just step right into the concept-gate, inhabit it, even though to do so feels like wilfully entering some kind of annihilation, whether it's solipsism-flavored or the undoing of mind something else. then, notice the breath. then, notice that everyone and everything is still self-evidently here.

each such transition ends up feeling like a .. like a firmware update? a tiny notch in the transcension series?

having a functional bead on observer-scheduling (via [wakingness](wakingness.md)) and _particularly_ the idea that there's only one observer (like Wheeler's one electron) is, for me at this specific time, a conceptual vector that aims me right into that well again. I have been here before, and it is absolutely okay. :) _observing_ that, manually inverting the experience, manually [applying a mirror](../17/true.md) to the signal, then experiencing both the signal and its reflection, feels like experiencing _current_. :zap:
