ah, it's been a while (months?) but I found another fear-of-god portal in concept-space, which is a sentence that sounds nonsense, but lemme recap:

it seems like "the fear of god" is pointing at a specific phenomenology around consciousness examining its own root. when one gets close to aiming straight down that infinite well, the system freaks out - the soul having a fear of heights, so to speak. it _seems_ like the most productive thing is to just step right into the concept-gate, inhabit it, even though to do so feels like wilfully entering some kind of annihilation, whether it's solipsism flavored or the undoing of mind something else. then, notice the breath. then, notice that everyone and everything is still self-evidently here.

each such transition ends up feeling like a .. like a firmware update? a tiny notch in the transcension series?

having a functional bead on observer-scheduling (via [wakingness](wakingness.md)) and _particularly_ the idea that there's only one observer (like Wheeler's one electron) is, for me at this specific time, a conceptual vector that aims me right into that well again. I have been here before, and it is absolutely okay. :) _observing_ that, manually inverting the experience, manually [applying a mirror](../17/true.md) to the signal, then experiencing both the signal and its reflection, feels like experiencing _current_. :zap:
