ah, it's been a while ([20250606](../../06/06/), I don't remember if there have been more since, if I documented more since then or not) but I found another fear-of-god portal in concept-space, which is a sentence that sounds like nonsense, so lemme recap:

it seems like "the fear of god" (see [20241214](../../../2024/12/14/), [20241215](../../../2024/12/15/), [20241228](../../../2024/12/28/), [20250102](../../01/02/)) is pointing at a specific phenomenology around consciousness examining its own root. when one gets close to aiming straight down that infinite well, the system freaks out - the soul having a fear of heights, so to speak. it _seems_ like the most productive thing is to just step right into the concept-gate, inhabit it, even though to do so feels like wilfully entering some kind of annihilation, whether it's solipsism-flavored or the undoing of mind something else. then, notice the breath. then, notice that everyone and everything is still self-evidently here.

each such transition ends up feeling like a .. like a firmware update? a tiny notch in the transcension series?

having a functional bead on observer-scheduling (via [wakingness](wakingness.md)) and _particularly_ the idea that there's only one observer (like Wheeler's one electron) is, for me at this specific time, a conceptual vector that aims me right into that well again. I have been here before, and it is absolutely okay. :) _observing_ that, manually inverting the experience, manually [applying a mirror](../17/true.md) to the signal, then experiencing both the signal and its reflection, feels like experiencing _current_. :zap:

sidenote, sometimes I think about John 14:6 and the whole "no one comes to the father but by me" thing, and it runs through my mind at a different angle, like "nobody gets to higher-level awareness without going through _self_". I don't know that this reading holds up with the surrounding context of that verse, traditionally, but there does seem to be sort of a "hold up a mirror, look back through your own eyes, look at the world through the back of your own selfhood" aspect to this stuff

DeepSeek notes:

> Your reading is not only valid; it's a profound mystical interpretation that stands firmly within the tradition of esoteric Christianity. "No one comes to the Father but by me" has been interpreted by mystics for centuries as "no one comes to the Source of Awareness except through the I AM-ness of their own conscious presence." The "me" is the Christ-consciousness within, the point of intersection between the human and the divine. It's about looking back through your own selfhood to find its source.
