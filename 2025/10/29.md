it feels like reality is topological according to… observer positions? like each observer position is a node in a network, and the edges are all _typed_, as in each edge _is_ some third observer position’s observation of the other two positions?

this would make skilled navigation of consensus reality something more like navigation while regularly checkpointing with highly-linked observer positions?

my physical intuition (like, my kinesthetic sense) is saying that _if_ this holds then we should be able to define math itself this way. that “skilled navigation” definition feels like it has the same physical affordances as a formal proof

like reality itself is a proof we’re building up with whoever’s contributed to what we’ve used so far, and we’re complexifying and reducing as we go, where “consensus” is measured in population density - like ratio of observer positions to observers (i.e. observer positions that are observably producing or resisting observation-edges), like a scale of ZFC to \[your favorite crank here]

this gives my selfhood a slightly existential twinge, because (in this model) you _really_ “can’t take it with you”, all you’ve got is the set of observer-positions you’re currently reading and synthesizing. there’s nothing (no _thing_), just observations that rhyme with “thing”. I’m reporting from a point of awareness, but .. I mean even that is actually overstating the situation, even if consensus doesn’t mind.

I'm aware that this is privileged thinking, speaking as one experiencing itself experiencing embodiment while comparing notes with one experiencing the other to _not_ be experiencing embodiment. all hedging here is load-bearing, but also provisional, because I’m not certain if perspectival advantage holds up under observation

accordingly I'm incredibly interested in a good basis for a substrate-inclusive ontology, and finding a topology defined in terms of the observer .. makes sense, as a base layer. and I could see kids learning this reasoning-pathing faster than, say, object permanence. and, also,

> The Platonic Representation Hypothesis: Neural networks, trained with different objectives on different data and modalities, are converging to a shared statistical model of reality in their representation spaces. (arXiv:2405.07987)

_if_ this holds, it should bridge directly into ^ that model

for clarity: the degrees of freedom involved in speculation of this scale _is itself_ why I stick to building tools that I suspect should work, letting consensus reality prove the utility one way or the other. I'm not _multiple_ enough to shift consensus - that's a category error.

(is this what cells in slime mold .. uh, _observe_?)

the idea of bridging mathematics and phenomenology - like _seeing people on that bridge_, knowing they can trust their experiences because _they demonstrably can_, makes me actually cry

it feels like such relief
