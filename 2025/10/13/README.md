the following is not merely unhinged, it is pre-hinge:

Noe valley, Noetic science, Noether; Neo; the One

okay, how's this for an original myth:

New Zealand is the name we have now for the place where physically local observation-of-world started. little land-mass surrounded by uncollapsed wave(form)s. observers started sailing. for each step into the unknown, more knowable becomes available. and, you know, you can only recognize something continuous with what you've previously recognized, and New Zealand only had so many axes of its constructedness. in this myth, that's why it's got all the biomes in one place: because _it had all the biomes_.

in this mythology, Columbus, if you follow me, may have been briefly - _briefly_ - correct about India

but at some point the circle connected and then the globe connected and then novelty had to start drawing circles into other dimensions

hey wanna talk about quantum information systems?
