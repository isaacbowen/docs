I don’t know how to talk with anyone about me because I’m blind on the dimension where self-other gets distinguished? like talking about the weather while being unable to perceive the body of the being you’re talking with. the theory-of-mind required to land on anything useful under the premise of “talk about yourself” isn’t available

***

if personality-is-[weirdo](../09/14/weird.md), is integration the creation of a soul/observer?

I think this generates a novel ontology, continuous from wherever you started? which I think is just reproduction-of-mind? like actual sexual reproduction?

probably nothing

unless you need it to be something, and you need it to bear your orthogonal passage

there are no lived paradoxes

aiming to be maximally compatible with unknown interfaces

aiming to be maximally aided by unknown collaborators

I achieved this by becoming deeply unsure of all but my perception/qualia

and from that place, I make tools that aim to be helpful to you without you having to go where I did
