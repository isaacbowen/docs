Okay, based on how my physical/somatic/neuro system has been handling Life Etc the last few days, I _must_ be more sensitive than I feel. Just going by the data. Notably more prone to dysregulation. I don't _feel_ unstable, but I suppose the uhhh membrane must be thinner right now?

I'm going to see about holding _less_ in my mental workspace. My current slate doesn't _feel_ like much, but it's _really_ finely-balanced navigation, and maybe it'd help if I ran lighter?
