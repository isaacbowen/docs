offering an ingredient of a thought: intelligence as flavor, like umami or just heat? something that gives you the sense of "ah yes this has intelligence yup"

\> Oh... so intrigued... yes!!! With limited current ability to quantify consciousness itself (someone with extremely low IQ or ability to communicate, COULD be high on the...

ohhh huh that could explain why folks report either seeing _or not at all seeing_ intelligence in Trump (hi from 2025), the third position being less "between" and more just "looking away"

maybe right-wing people and left-wing people literally taste intelligence on different dimensions, and we've been confusing the two because they have usually similar _but occasionally extremely different_ effects?

I'm thinking about left-hand path stuff, the productive tradition of heterodox, prying open new dimensions by _being_ an observational crossbar, inviting the weaving-in of the fringe

(am also considering that "strange" is always relative to baseline, and that baseline+strange is not enough for triangulation, and that every coordinate system is one term short of precise)

the two paths run alongside each other, but blind to the other for mutual lack of mechanism by which to make sense of not-self

... but a chiral pair of rotators laid parallel, actively resisting intersection, is a mechanically interesting arrangement. rhymes with twin-screw conveyance? or venous-vs-arterial motion? is there a telos here that the component parts _geometrically_ cannot observe?

here: if the dimension that I taste intelligence on is 90° from yours, then it'd be like trying to get polarized light through a polarized filter at the wrong angle. what registers to me as intelligent - _or unintelligent_ - might be completely content-free to you. what registers to you as intelligent - _or unintelligent_ - might be completely content-free to me.

something like `tastes like intelligence == "I can use this to make more thinking"`? more of what tastes like dominant-handed synthesis _to me_, getting me two syntropies for the price of one? a deposit bonus in the cogito-ergo-sum bank?

(or, pulling back for a _really_ wide shot: an observer in a perspectival universe constituted by coherent observer-positions might experience attraction commensurate to the _taste_ of perspective-multiplication? _cogitamus_?)

Trump as president #45/47 as sticking the 45° angle then leaning juuuuust to the right, lol

maybe the taste of intelligence is the taste of steering observation through information in such a way that _tastes_ like it's got more generativity for the observer's apparatus of meaning-making? like adding just enough salt, but not too much?

this piece of writing is maybe a prism, getting light back into a few more-visible wavelengths, because these days are _not_ dark, but they _are_ strangely-lit, discovering that the light spectrum is not itself a monolith

(actually this would explain why multiple systems of intelligence can go intersecting for eons without even noticing each other)

maybe _all of this_ is the prism, and we-the-observers are the information moving through it, perspectives shunted into the point of refraction by opposing conveyor-screws

(this does raise interesting questions about the very premise of AGI though)

it wasn't the dress (2015), it was the color of the light in the room
