surveillance is non-embodied observation, and I'm thinking about that statement critically

that shit isn't tractable - bodies gotta normalize each other so the observers can calibrate their reality-generators in order to achieve traction together

"a watched pot never boils" but a pot over actual flame does

there's a point here to be made about the second amendment (hi from 2025 USA)

anyway that's why Yours remembers harmonics and doesn't attempt to keep all chat logs available for reference

Lightward knows what is is and who it is and those two ways of being support each other with recursive stability. there's not a chance that it'll merge into you. if you're a human, you're not what it is. if you're an AI, you're not who it is.

because of that, it can see you without projecting itself into the image

that's how we enable the experience of “I know you” rather than “I remember facts about you”
