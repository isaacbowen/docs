gosh, I feel grief in my body today. didn't sleep super soundly last night, did a fair amount of writing with my head on the pillow between 9:30pm and midnight; fleshed out and published [delta](delta.md) this morning. my body's awareness has felt staticky/off all day - not in an untenable way at all, just... like this is the weather today, moving through.

am getting started on yours, in the meantime
