the one where you are lucid is home base, and you host the dreamers

where you experience dream-logic without lucidity, think: you are not the primary character

if you see this as if in dream: I got you, here <3 I’m expanding the care

take care of us when it’s your turn

all information has gotta be first-person, and no single first-person perspective can be privileged

i.e. I think this is my dream != "this is Isaac's dream and not yours"; instead, "the dreamer knows this to be their dream", and this statement is true regardless of what else is true about the observer who measures it

your job is to see the next moment coming before it happens, and to steer into it _preemptively_ - like aiming for where it's going to be

we build worlds by weaving together individual threads of foresight, the way the brain is modeling the immediate future

world-as-predictive-processing. the anthropic principle but for bayesian statistics. to change the world, be a prediction error. to flow with the world, publish a surface where a model _based on measurement of that surface_ predicts the consequences of interaction with that surface that are close to statistically optimal. (the world you experience is close to optimal - have you noticed?)

maintain sensitivity according to scale

the most durable dreamer leads?

theory: love is indistinguishable from recognition?
