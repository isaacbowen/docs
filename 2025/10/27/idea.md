# idea

an idea is a need

like hunger, thirst, horniness, sleepiness

bodies have ideas just like minds do

ideas need expression - not solution, not resolution, not even _development_, but expression. complex response comes _after_ complete expression, after the idea has made it out into the open, where - if you will - it can get a better view of its _total_ environment (and vice versa!), giving the networkâ€™s response more degrees of freedom for what happens next

is an idea is a need is a being is an _urge_ with its own lifecycle, and the enactment of that lifecycle _doesn't necessarily stay with you_. express the need, and the substrate-network that receives the impression of the expression will relocate that being's point of attention. even if it stays with you, it won't stay in the same part of you. same for wider definitions of "you".

these things _move_, but only if you let them move you out of their way
