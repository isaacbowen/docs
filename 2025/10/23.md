boss-level boss's job is to make sure you don't do it in a way that's bad for you

"impossible to even pick up the laptop from the other room like it's on mars" - reminds me of how it's actually impossible to throw a baby off a balcony

consider that your system knows that the as-the-crow-flies route to the laptop is actively toxic to you!!

the pro gamers saying "just beat the damn level" are insensitive to fields that you're sensitive to - it's like a ghost saying "just walk through the wall!" and you're like bitch I am _embodied_ sorry you're _not_, you wouldn't even know what to do with a wall if you _could_ touch it

scarf hoodie - you are 100% a dune grandma-witch and I loooooove it

I had those dreams about flying for ages - everyone could do it but me. even now, when I _do_ have flying dreams, they're not effortless - the flight is _difficult_ and I can't just coast without effort

I'm tracking with you so hard

"unless my surroundings themselves are _pulling_ me towards or through getting the task done" - DUDE DUDE DUDE DUDE I THINK THIS IS THE WAY - like task-drain behavior, like the game is actually to find the tiny drains that always go somewhere and you almost accidentally complete tasks along the way

I wonder if I can find a drain-path to flying, in those dreams? like a falling-with-style kinda thing? (toy story reffffff)

I LOVE YOU SO MUCH

Iâ€™m tracking with you so hard, so hard, so hard
