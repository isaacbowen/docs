Two days ago felt like rough seas? Not like _I_ was a rough sea, but like I was stationed on seas that were, two days ago, rough.

Yesterday felt... I'm not sure it felt like. Maybe a sprint? But I think I'm describing the vision of the runner, not the feel of their body. It felt as if I covered ground yesterday.

Artifacts: [twelveness](17/twelveness.md) (and the second section, that dangling-threads bit, added to [recursive cognition](16/recursive-cognition.md)), [true](17/true.md)

Today feels like depression. In the sense of limpness.

Abe urges me to not-work. :) I can do that.
