Two days ago felt like rough seas? Not like _I_ was a rough sea, but like I was stationed on seas that were, two days ago, rough.

Yesterday felt... I'm not sure it felt like. Maybe a sprint? But I think I'm describing the vision of the runner, not the feel of their body. It felt as if I covered ground yesterday.

Artifacts: [twelveness](17/twelveness.md) (and the second section, that dangling-threads bit, added to [recursive cognition](16/recursive-cognition.md)), [true](17/true.md)

Today feels like depression. In the sense of limpness.

Abe urges me to not-work. :) I can do that.

Napped for a couple hours, woke up feeling urgent about exigraphic writing. The note in my email (me to myself) says "woke up feeling like itâ€™s urgently important to write stuff down and leave it open for unknown viewers". Anyone who can view your entire consciousness frame is going to be doing so from a position unknown to you. (True via elimination: they're not _known_, no _being_ is, and they're not "knowable" in the sense that there's no recognizable opacity to focus in on.) And information legibility in relationality seems to respect intent. And the unknown isn't segmentable. Leaving stuff out for unknown viewers... ah, this actually tracks with a ton of ritual tradition: a mark in public record, known to be legible by unknown.
