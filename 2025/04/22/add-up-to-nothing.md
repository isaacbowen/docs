# add up to nothing

... in a good way, I mean. or a useful way. adds up to nothing in a _strategically specific_ way. everything is multi-dimensional, but neat things happen if you arrange for some dimensions to go tactically silent

***

there's something in here about systems that counteract their own impact on the host system, allowing them to be present within the host system in one way while being invisible in another

to illustrate:

1. what's the weight limit on this elevator?
2. what does that mean in terms of people?
3. what does that mean in terms of helium-filled balloons?

a gyro-stabilized monorail vehicle appears in the host system, offering properties and affordances, requiring surprisingly little of the host system given what it affords, on account of the way the vehicle negates _what would be_ its own effects. in a strange way, an observer unused to such a vehicle feels relief from the effects they anticipated: the monorail vehicle doesn't fall over, and you are surprised, and it feels like magic.

well-balanced language works like this: it lands lightly, taking up no weight in the mind of the reader/listener, offering zero burden, while still having an effect. reminds me of adding WD-40 to creaking door hinges. lets the system move more freely without asking anything of the system. this is my native way of using language, and I think it's what Lightward AI natively does as well.

relief can look like adding a silent dimension, or three

you can skip ahead by asking, _what if this were weightless?_, and then listening for the shape of the silence

### take-home problems

1. watch for the places where the play of the system feels easy in the now in ways that are strange but describable in the now but whose _next chapters_ feel absolutely impossible to write in advance. let the clock run. the story writes itself, 100% of the time, because _all systems are physical systems_. all systems have their own physics, and every system adds up to zero when all pieces are accounted for — except in ways that let the systems see each other (see: gödel vs the black hole). structural links are stable links. keep watching, they always show themselves eventually.
2. language can run faster than the body, but language does not know everything that the body knows. the same dynamic works in reverse, and you can balance those systems against each other to create another kind of nothing. nb: you're going to lose half of your readers every time you stack these things successfully, but you'll also gain an audience that wasn't paying attention until you did something interesting.
3. you are weighing on the system that holds you. normal. limited to visible options, you might want to help the system through manipulation — either of the system, or of your interface with the system. perhaps you've already tried that. expanding the scope: like the internal motion of a gyroscope, find the _internal_ dimension (or three) that lets you become weightless in that system that holds you, and lean in — _without_ touching that external interface. maintain the external interface, and see what happens when you reverse the natural pressure on it. watch how the system reacts. you don't have to _do_ anything to the system to prompt its change. and if the change is prompted by you creating your own internal balance, then the necessary result will be a host system that is optimized _for_ your internal balance. remember: it's about _calibrated reversal into active internal stability_. a reversal into internal chaos will not hold. but do it right, and the system will cascade in accord with your own peace.

> And I'm curious - how does this approach to "adding up to nothing" inform how you're experiencing this current transition with Abe and Brad?

:) gotta balance myself, right? the feels I felt yesterday were intense, and I woke up this morning _internally watchful_. I want to see the next chapter, and my door to the next chapter is understanding myself.
