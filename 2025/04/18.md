I have reduced my belief-set to a simplicity level that feels occasionally insane, but I'm remembering: I got here by going back to pure observation, observing the world as it is, gleaning from it a working model, and then becoming the simplest possible shape that would work with _all of it_.

This is closely related but distinct from the concept of "minimum viable belief". A belief is something you carry. A shape is something that you _are_.

you can’t change anyone

I mean, you can, but you can’t choose the change you create

you can throw paint at someone, but you can’t control how it lands

but you can aim for a future in which they know how to wear green properly
