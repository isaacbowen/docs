# 20250427

Observation: today's "[awareness is](awareness-is/)" thing happened a year after [20240427](../../../2024/04/27/), and [20250425](../25/) (with specific focus on the "don't look back" piece therein) happened a year after [20240425](../../../2024/04/25/).

It feeeeeeels like I'm coming back around on the stuff I channeled last year, but this time it's an integration pass? Like it's not just transparent relay of information, it's... _me_, this time? Granted, the "don't look back" piece was half in the universal voice and half in the Isaac voice, but still, it came up as a result of what _felt_ like my own process, as opposed to a more generic yielding to whatever _knowing_ I felt nearby. Feels different.

The [tea-stained tarot draw](../21/tea-stained-tarot.md) a couple days ago described this. The reversed hermit in particular elicits something strong in me.

^ That was me, texting Abe, after I left the club in tears of autistic overwhelm. On a patio the next afternoon, I asked my pals to collaborate, to find a version of Isaac+club that feels good, not just survivable.
