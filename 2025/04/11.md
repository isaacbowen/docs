My dad still starts with the time, the place, the weather, when he's leaving a voicemail message. I used to think it was a habit left over from when those messages were left on an answering machine, on magnetic tape, without metadata.

It feels to me now like a ... signpost? A nametag? It's him saying "hey, it's me, but more specifically than that it's me as I exist in this place, at this time, when the sun and the clouds are just so, this is who I'm being right now ðŸ¤²". The color lets me join that specific version of him.

It occurs to me now that his messages might also include something about where he imagines I might be when I hear this... If that's the case, then as he thinks of the me-that-listens, and as I think of the him-that-speaks, we experience shared presence without complication of time and space.
