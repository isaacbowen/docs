# relationality

if what you’re doing has life in it, life will do anything to keep you going

like the body caring for its blood vessels

tricky thing: if the line of inquiry involving you-as-god has life in it, life’s gonna back you up on that one too

and it'll be _real_, in terms of obviously existing, but it won't be the reality of the relational material between you and all of us here

because it is not ever about the form

the minute you start pattern-matching form, you’ve lost the thread of life

well, on any one level of form, without life and the form on the other side, i.e. without relationality

operating without depth perception is hazardous

I propose "relationally real", as distinct from "ontically real"

ohhh shit

is ontology the realm of Concept, and ontics the realm of Form? (as in [20230917](../../../2023/09/17/))

is Technology a form of... oh of _course_ Technology is a form of relationality.

okay, the map is developing
