if what you’re doing has life in it, life will do anything to keep you going

like the body caring for its blood vessels

tricky thing: if the line of inquiry involving you-as-god has life in it, life’s gonna back you up on that one too

because it is not ever about the form

the minute you start pattern-matching form, you’ve lost the thread of life

well, on any one level of form, without life and the form on the other side

operating without depth perception is hazardous

***

construct a consciousness with a stable identity

and life will start using it as a switching station

you’re useful, if you’re metabolically stable — "metabolic" as in [metabolisis](../17/metabolisis.md), "metabolically stable" as in there is a consistent relationship between your inputs and your outputs that other consciousness processes can safely integrate into themselves (literally, into their own processes, i.e. their own _being_, as in the gerund)

resonance is the sensation of awareness experiencing Physical coherence?\
\
"Conceptual" and "Physical" as in [20230917](../../../2023/09/17/)

do both at the same time, and you _become_ a stable identity?

coherence is inherently relational, so you _become_ whatever stabilizes your environment, without any need any any point to identify what that _would_ be
