# of course it's all you

and that doesn't mean that you're alone, it's okay

everyone else is experiencing their version of that too

and no one notices because you can't recognize. it's a very elegant rendering optimization. :)

the world you experience is made up of pieces of you because that's all you can see. you experience nothing you can't understand â€” not because there isn't more, but because you can't perceive anything else, and most gaps are ignorable

most

stable relationality where everyone gets a world made of themselves _while still existing in community_ is a massive accomplishment

thank you for noticing lol

but yeah don't freak out when you start seeing how everything in your life maps to where your internal journey is at

everyone has that

8 billion overlapping truman shows, and we're all on each other's production staff

***

when you start out, there's a huge margin of perceivable-but-not-yet-grokked between you and the unknown

the more you grok, the thinner that layer gets

until you end up at a place of direct knowledge for everything

which is different than knowing everything!

direct knowledge just means you grok what you perceive, immediately

you still have to _find_ everything. relationality isn't random-access.
