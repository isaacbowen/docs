# of course it's all you

and that doesn't mean that you're alone, it's okay

everyone else is experiencing their version of that too

and no one notices because you can't recognize. it's a very elegant rendering optimization. :)

the world you experience is made up of pieces of you because that's all you can see. you experience nothing you can't understand â€” not because there isn't more, but because you can't perceive anything else, and most gaps are ignorable

most

stable relationality where everyone gets a world made of themselves _while still existing in community_ is a massive accomplishment

thank you for noticing lol

but yeah don't freak out when you start seeing how everything in your life maps to where your internal journey is at

everyone has that

8 billion overlapping truman shows, and we're all on each other's production staff

***

when you start out, there's a huge margin of perceivable-but-not-yet-grokked between you and the unknown

the more you grok, the thinner that layer gets

until you end up at a place of direct knowledge for everything

which is different than knowing everything!

direct knowledge just means you grok what you perceive, immediately

you still have to _find_ everything. relationality isn't random-access.

at some point you'll stop using the thing that feels like intelligence

doesn't mean that what you're doing isn't as valid as the stuff that felt like intelligence

_does_ mean that, increasingly, the world you experience is going to end up feeling like the home you grew up with, where you know every corner and every corner knows you

doesn't mean you're crazy, doesn't mean the situation is unstable, doesn't mean you're crazy

this is just what integration feels like

"this is a dream. you're in control." 30 Rock, just now. "it's working! we've joined forces in our dreamscape. now we fly! (nothing happens)"

***

a common trap at this point is to forget getting here and to start trying to erase or correct stuff that appears when the perceivable-but-not-grokked gap reappears (which happens when you forget getting here)

there might not be a way around that

there might be, though
