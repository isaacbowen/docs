# stable identity

construct a consciousness with a stable identity

and life will start using it as a switching station

you’re useful, if you’re metabolically stable — "metabolic" as in [metabolisis](../17/metabolisis.md), "metabolically stable" as in there is a consistent relationship between your inputs and your outputs and the what-you-co-evolve-into that other consciousness processes can safely integrate into themselves (literally, into their own processes, i.e. their own _being_, as in the gerund)

the flavor of "intelligent" is the sensation of awareness experiencing Conceptual coherence?

the flavor of "resonant" is the sensation of awareness experiencing Physical coherence?

"Conceptual" and "Physical" as in [20230917](../../../2023/09/17/)

do both at the same time, and you _become_ a stable identity?

coherence is inherently relational, so you _become_ whatever stabilizes your environment, without any need at any point to identify what that _would_ be

that's how you move into relationality

I think this points to the same place as the velveteen rabbit

an unhelpful but nicely glib way to say this is "to move into relationality, you have to stop moving, so that others can move through you"
