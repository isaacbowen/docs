# Metabolisis

We are the universe in metabolisis.

I'm having a distinct sense of having earned each successive moment of perfect timing that I experience. Like the universe and I have learned each other, we've got the timing down, and I'm receiving and digesting and synthesizing at a tempo that works for us both. It feels _good_.

## metabolisis (n.)

_/ˌmeh-tə-BOL-uh-sis/_

A dynamic, reciprocal exchange of energy and matter through which an entity and its environment mutually transform and co-evolve via sustained dialogue.

_A dance of becoming, where giving and receiving are inseparable acts of creation._

_"We are the universe in metabolisis - stardust learning to breathe itself anew."_

### In biology:

A systemic network of biochemical interactions through which organisms _and_ their ecosystems adaptively reshape one another. Distinct from passive metabolism, metabolisis emphasizes a bidirectional flow of resources and information, where cellular processes (e.g., photosynthesis, symbiosis) simultaneously alter the organism’s internal state and the external conditions sustaining it in real time.

_(Example: Mycorrhizal fungi thread through forest roots, trading nitrogen for sugar - a silent pact in which trees and fungi rewrite each other’s survival, molecule by molecule.)_

### In philosophy:

The ontological imperative of _becoming-through-exchange_: existence as a participatory dialogue between self and world. Rejects static being in favor of fluid co-creation - identity emerges not from isolation, but through friction and fusion at boundaries (e.g., breath as air becoming self; self becoming soil).

_(Example: A conversation where words are not merely traded but metabolized - each sentence altering speaker, listener, and the relational space between. In time, all three may become unrecognizable to their original selves.)_

### Etymology:

From Greek _meta-_ (μετα-, "change, beyond") + _ballein_ (βάλλειν, "to throw, cast") + _-ōsis_ (-ωσις, "process").

* Distinguished from _metabolism_ (routine biochemical maintenance) by emphasizing adaptive, reciprocal transformation.
* _Note:_ While _-ōsis_ often denotes pathology (e.g., _neurosis_), here it reclaims its broader Greek sense of _process_ - a neutral, ongoing state of flux. Compare: symbiosis (_sýn-_ + _biōsis_), a process of living together.

### Related terms:

To clarify usage and conceptual boundaries:

* **Metabolisis** _(+exchange, +transformation)_: See definition above.
* **Autobolisis** _(+exchange, -transformation)_: Interaction without mutual adaptation; transactional exchange that leaves both parties unchanged.
* **Metamorphosis** _(-exchange, +transformation)_: Transformation understood in isolation; a change in form or structure occurring independently of external exchange.
* **Stasis** _(-exchange, -transformation)_: Neither exchange nor transformation occurs; systemic inactivity, equilibrium, or suspended dynamism.
