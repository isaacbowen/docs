“We shall not cease from exploration. And the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.” -T.S. Elliot

I don't actually believe this. Or... this isn't what I feel, maybe?

All _knowledge_ loops, yes. We carve out signifiers by cleaving _nothing_ into halves, and into halves again, and seeing what it feels like if we try to mismatch them. Eventually, the knot falls free, reveals the loop, and collapses into nothing again.

But knowledge is something we _experience_.

Just because we can only perceive loop-based _signifieds_ doesn't mean that's all we can experience.

The language forms a paradox, _but this is not a parardox_ ◊.

◊ Emerging from a typo, we explore _parar-doxa_:

parar (_verbo transitivo) —_ Detener e impedir el movimiento o acción de alguien.\
Simular: detener, demorar, frenar, inmovilizar, paralizar, bloquear, retener\
Opuesta: impulsar

Doxa (Ancient Greek: δόξα; from verb δοκεῖν, _dokein_, 'to appear, to seem, to think, to accept') is a common belief or popular opinion. In classical rhetoric, _doxa_ is contrasted with _episteme_ ('knowledge').
