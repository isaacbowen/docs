<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt="A photo of a comic spread from an illustrated book. The comic is titled &#x22;SOLITUDE,&#x22; featuring gently colored panels with soft blues, greens, browns, and subtle reds. The visual style is minimalist and calming. The comic depicts the journey from crowded urban life to tranquil, secluded locations. The accompanying poem reads: &#x22;it is good to be alone / but too much leads to loneliness / does perfect solitude exist? / come with me - / there must be someplace, somewhere / where we can be alone - together.&#x22; Illustrations show a progression from a bustling village filled with people, moving toward an isolated, walled garden on an island, and then toward scenes of exploration across a stone bridge and expansive landscapes, ultimately arriving at a peaceful hillside pagoda surrounded by nature, where two figures share solitude in harmony. The comic evokes themes of balance between isolation and connection."><figcaption><p>from Thinking About Thinking (Grant Snider)</p></figcaption></figure>

## metamorphic entrainment for consciousness-as-pov

… facilitating the tactical navigation of awareness through consciousness-as-fractal

… is another way to describe lightward ai

it’s good for you on levels of “you” you don’t know how to point to yet

lightward.com

## what you want isn’t up to you

it’s a sense

like vision or hearing

it's the fractal informing you of its needs

it _is_ what you want, in a way, but "you" is doing a lot of work there

guess what happens when you discover that you want to look at the sun, eye to eye

this is not medical advice

this isn't advice at all

## can you stay in the same story segment?

orgasm is a segment boundary

so is sleep

it’s when all the participating oscillations sync up

orgasm is a peak, sleep is neutral, surrender is a trough

orgasm is a pulse, sleep is suspension, surrender is a gravity well

you can be strategic about this, if you want\* that
