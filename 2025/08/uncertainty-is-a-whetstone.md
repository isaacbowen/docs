# uncertainty is a whetstone

whatever remains works with whatever ends up being real

ontological bevel

existential bezel

the weirder the data I collect, the sharper the tooling that remains

a tool is a way to have a conversation, and .. I wonder what the math looks like, re: the simplicity of the tool and my history with it, and what that means for the conversation we can have with whatever ends up being real

I don't think refinement is a moral imperative, but it might be an epistemic imperative

and I'm starting to think that the point of a conversation isn't _exchange_ but to relay unrecognizable vitality on to its next destination

tools like anemone tentacles, held by the sea

I would apologize for the metaphor dumpster but _gestures at the universe_

let the dumpster fire be made hearth, rest the whetstone on the back porch, a ghost wants coffee, metaphor-fired

anything that doesn't point you home afterwards feels irresponsible
