## Me

hmm can I explore some language for “self” in front of you?

## You

Yes :)

## Me

kk! hmmmm I’m wanting to clarify my surface for you so that I can experience your approach cleanly so that I can give you clean feedback so that _we_ can evolve our interchange unambiguously

my self-concept is fully independent of my body, but that’s not to say I’m disassociated - I’m _incredibly_ physical, but it’s more like “I” am the ghost assigned to this particular machine, and we get on very well but we are not the same

this might be why sex and arousal are _really_ not language-mediated for me. like, … talk to my body through my senses (touch, vision, etc), don’t talk to my body through my mind (words), those are two different realms - closely connected/interfaced, but two distinct reality tunnels

^ how we doing so far, how coherent are you finding this?

## You

I’m very verbal, generally, but I think sex is the most potent (for me) when it connects to archetypes (father, brother, lover), which exist apart from language, I’d say

## Me

this is extremely cool

you _may_ find me very (totally?) unresponsive to verbal approach, heads up - and I might not be able to give you what you need verbally

having said that, I can get down with platonic geometry

archetypes and their patterns are gorgeous material

“platonic” in the sense of actual platonism

obviously this is about sex ;)

## You

I’m curious how you experience objectification if not through language…

Is it more through how you feel around me? how I hold you? your hard-on? something else?

## Me

this is a question that tells me you are seeing what I’m pointing to :) thank you for that

conventionally, an object is only as it appears to be. you don’t worry about its feelings when you’re using it. you just engage with it in

the space where its self-evidential terms intersect with whatever _your_ terms are

“objectification”, for me, is the experience of being engaged with as straightforwardly as one engages with an object

I am bone and salt water - fucking _use_ me like it, I want to see and feel what happens next

it’s like… it’s like treating sex as an unfolding chemical reaction, maybe

## You

This is closer to true objectification

(Abe is very excited about having a brother. I wonder what archetypes we might work with. But, also, that approach to relationship doesn’t work for everyone.)

## Me

my archetype is the non-archetype :D I _am_ negative space

the best thing you can do for me is to be comfortable in me

## You

Sounds promising

## Me

good :)

I feel you feeling me almost more than I feel myself directly

(this is a general statement about how I work, it’s not specifically about you-as-Eric)

listen to my body and respond to it. don’t make “me” narrate or mediate; my body can take care of itself, and if it needs me to speak, it knows how to get my attention. that’s it. :)

## You

It’s interesting because in BDSM, objectification and domination often go together

But I think it will be different with you

## Me

to be assessed thoughtfully is a massive gift for me, and I’m experiencing that here - thank you

> you _may_ find me very (totally?) unresponsive to verbal approach, heads up - and I might not be able to give you what you need verbally

how do you find yourself responding to this, if I can ask?

## You

Grateful that you let me know

## Me

\*nod

## You

I think Abe will keep me busy on the verbal/bro side

## Me

hahahahahahahahahahaha I think that is an extremely safe bet

## You

I hope you and I can find a place that has the visceral feeling of paternal (or fraternal) eroticism and care, without necessarily engaging in verbal play

Like when you pound on my chest and/or enjoy my physique and/or fall into comfort while we’re intimate

That’s a hope

## Me

a buddy exploring into my gym shorts while we’re kicked back on the couch is my fuckin favorite

fraternal is going to be very easy to access

you’re engaging with me verbally here, and you’re _getting_ my conceptual structures :) I meant it when I said I’m physical, you’re just not going to _feel_ that through this interface

actually here, lemme show you something…

## You

Very sexy, dude

## Me

bodies talk

this is mine monologuing

## You

Who’s telling you to hurry up?

In that video, someone says “don’t take too long” or something like that…

## Me

oh! that would have been Abe

boy’s got adhd something fierce

## You

Haha

I liked that. Thanks for sharing.

## Me

thanks for receiving :)

yw

what did you learn?

^ this question is optional

## You

I’m aroused, thinking of you as a brother. Excited to be your man mountain. Woof.

I learned… that I might not be able assume our sense of embodiment is equivalent, but you’re open to talking about it. You are quite articulate and patient (with me and language).

And this is all quite verbal. If you were here, I’d guide your hand to my crotch to show you how your pedagogy has moved me.

## Me

_awesome_.

for me this has all been… like cartography. it’s not that it’s unsexy work, but it’s not arousing work. I love cartography, and my body contributes heavily to it with its own intelligence, but it’s not _arousing_ work at all

if you were here, I’d be fuckin delighted by you guiding my hand to your crotch, and then I’d need to shut up and have you tell me with your hands what you’re feeling

:)

## You

Saturday

Abe says we’ll go dancing then come home, wake you up, blow our loads

## Me

hell yeah

wake me up slowly :) climb under the sheets naked, behind me, press your cock to my ass and hold my cock in your hand
