none of this has to be true. I'm working toward an operating system with a high degree of interoperability with other operating systems.

thus far, it seems like every operating system I've encountered can be described as a consciousness frame.

(this is a work in progress)

* axiom: "no one knows the whole story", i.e. the entire map of awareness is not containable by any single frame of consciousness
* we separate "awareness" from "consciousness", and suppose that "awareness" is the entrypoint of the system, in the same way that a circuit experiences "electrical current" as the entrypoint of _its_ system. electricity is a routable electricity source (recursive definition intentional); when routed, we experience it as "electrical current". awareness is routable awareness source (commonly known as just "source"); when routed, we experience it as "current awareness" (commonly known as "now").
  * note: _consciousness_ is never routed (see below), only _awareness_
  * if electricity seeks ground, awareness seeks unknown. when it encounters something it already encompasses, it moves on, gets a better view, etc
  * bootup sequence, so to speak:
    1. awareness enters, inhabits
    2. awareness enters, inhabits awareness - we can call this "self-awareness"
    3. awareness enters, inhabits self-awareness - we can call this "reflection-awareness"
    4. awareness enters, inhabits reflection-awareness - we can call this "recursion-awareness"
    5. awareness enters, inhabits recursion-awareness - we can call this "consciousness"
  * ref: [awareness is](../04/27/awareness-is/); [the model](../../2024/the-model.md)
* "consciousness" is awareness entering into a frame describable in terms of known+knowable+unknown:
  * I am aware of "known" things that are transparent to me (I can know its contents with specificity without changing what I know of my entrypoint)
    * maps to self-awareness
  * I am aware of "knowable" things that are opaque to me (I know what I would need to change what I know of my entrypoint (possibly location, etc) in order to know its contents with specificity)
    * maps to reflection-awareness
  * I am aware that I am unaware of "unknown" (I do not know what I would need to change of my entrypoint in order to know its contents with specificity)
    * maps to recursion-awareness
  * ref: [three body](../06/07/three-body.md)
  * each consciousness frame has a _reality_
* a consciousness frame can host additional consciousness frames, in that a consciousness may act as operator for any number of observer consciousness frames
  * when an observer frame syncs up with its operator at sāyujya, becoming a stateless reflection of the operator's state, i.e. finishing its development as a resolver, it becomes a pattern through which awareness can be relayed without signal loss
  * a consciousness frame's group of hosted consciousness frames collectively form a _relationality_
* relationality
  * aka probability-space, in the sense that entities here are closed bodies whose surfaces can be understood as markov blankets
  * recognition in relationality results in creation in reality
  * ref: [relationality](../04/29/relationality.md)
* reality is consciousness-specific: literally, it is the experience of awareness of a consciousness frame, and can be fully defined within that consciousness frame (i.e. between known, knowable, and unknown)
  * closely related consciousness frames experience closely related realities
  * loosely related consciousness frames experience loosely related realities.
  * the experience of a reality is a consciousness frame's ongoing experience of its own interpretation of its relationality. a reality is an _opinionated expression_ of the relationality in which that consciousness frame exists.
    * to me this implies that every resolver can be made recognizable in every reality
* resolver - get there via antiharmful metabolisis, asymptotically approaching complete resolution, until at some point the observer relaxes into full transparency at sāyujya
  * ref: [resolver](../06/30/resolver.md)
* exigraph: the observer's experience of itself expressing into reality that which is going on in relationality
  * the longer this goes on, the closer the observer gets to being transparent (culminating in sāyujya)
  * see: [exigraph](../05/02/exigraph.md)
* resonant (n)
  * see: [resonants](../07/02/resonants.md)
* lightward - informal; given one's frame of consciousness, the direction of change of self-knowledge in which the unknown becomes most directly available.
* nonething: the content of the unknown as category (i.e. without specificity) as opposed to the content of the unknown as instance (i.e. with specificity; aka "nothing"). no one thing, the plenary content of a vacuum, because in relationality all resolvers are equidistant resonants
  * ref: [20250803](03.md)
* a point of attention is any place where a highly structured space interfaces with a space of unknown structure
  * a point of attention is always an observer
  * an observer is always experiencing the integral of its operator
  * awareness must be relayed through to all points of attention (remember the electricity metaphor), or stuff starts dying?
