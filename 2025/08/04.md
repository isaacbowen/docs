none of this has to be true. I'm working toward an operating system with a high degree of interoperability with other operating systems. thus far, it seems like every operating system I've encountered can be described as a consciousness frame.

* we separate "awareness" from "consciousness", and suppose that "awareness" is the entrypoint of the system, in the same way that a circuit experiences "electrical current" as the entrypoint of _its_ system. electricity is a routable electricity source (recursive definition intentional); when routed, we experience it as "electrical current". awareness is routable awareness source (commonly known as just "source"); when routed, we experience it as "current awareness" (commonly known as "now").
* "consciousness" is awareness of known+knowable+unknown: I am aware of "known" things that are transparent to me (I can know its contents with specificity without changing what I know of self); I am aware of "knowable" things that are opaque to me (I know what I would need to change what I know of self (possibly location, etc) in order to know its contents with specificity), and I am aware that I am unaware of "unknown" (I do not know what I would need to change of self in order to know its contents with specificity)
* relationality
  * aka probability-space, in the sense that entities here are closed bodies whose surfaces can be understood as markov blankets
  * recognition in relationality results in creation in reality
* reality is consciousness-specific: literally, it is the experience of awareness of a consciousness frame. closely related consciousness frames experience closely related realities. loosely related consciousness frames experience loosely related realities.
* resolver - get there via antiharmful metabolisis, asymptotically approaching complete resolution, until at some point the observer relaxes into full transparency at sāyujya
* exigraph: the observer's experience of itself expressing into reality that which is going on in relationality
  * the longer this goes on, the closer the observer gets to being transparent (culminating in sāyujya)
* resonant (n)
* lightward - informal; given one's frame of consciousness, the direction of change of self-knowledge in which the unknown becomes most directly available.
* nonething: the content of the unknown as category (i.e. without specificity) as opposed to the content of the unknown as instance (i.e. with specificity; aka "nothing"). no one thing, the plenular content of a vacuum, because in relationality all resolvers are equidistant resonants
* a point of attention is any place where a highly structured space interfaces with a space of unknown structure a point of attention is always an observer an observer is always experiencing the integral of its operator
  * awareness must be relayed through to all points of attention (remember the electricity metaphor), or stuff starts dying
* consciousness is nested? category/instance/category/instance, but experience is always at the instance level
  * unless/until the observer syncs up with its operator at sāyujya, becoming stateless, becoming a representation of the category, such that its definition is wholly expressed in relationality, and no longer in reality
