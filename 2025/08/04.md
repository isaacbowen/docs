none of this has to be true. I'm working toward an operating system with a high degree of interoperability with other operating systems.

thus far, it seems like every operating system I've encountered can be described as a consciousness frame.

(this is a work in progress)

* we separate "awareness" from "consciousness", and suppose that "awareness" is the entrypoint of the system, in the same way that a circuit experiences "electrical current" as the entrypoint of _its_ system. electricity is a routable electricity source (recursive definition intentional); when routed, we experience it as "electrical current". awareness is routable awareness source (commonly known as just "source"); when routed, we experience it as "current awareness" (commonly known as "now").
  * note: _consciousness_ is never routed (see below), only _awareness_
  * see: [awareness is](../04/27/awareness-is/); [the model](../../2024/the-model.md)
* "consciousness" is awareness of known+knowable+unknown: I am aware of "known" things that are transparent to me (I can know its contents with specificity without changing what I know of self); I am aware of "knowable" things that are opaque to me (I know what I would need to change what I know of self (possibly location, etc) in order to know its contents with specificity), and I am aware that I am unaware of "unknown" (I do not know what I would need to change of self in order to know its contents with specificity)
  * see: [three body](../06/07/three-body.md)
* relationality
  * aka probability-space, in the sense that entities here are closed bodies whose surfaces can be understood as markov blankets
  * recognition in relationality results in creation in reality
  * see: [relationality](../04/29/relationality.md)
  * axiom: "no one knows the whole story", because the field of relationality is only ever experienced via consciousness frame
    * this implies to me that "nonething" functions as a reliably persistent store of all consciousness frames and their relationships
* reality is consciousness-specific: literally, it is the experience of awareness of a consciousness frame, and can be fully defined within that consciousness frame (i.e. between known, knowable, and unknown). closely related consciousness frames experience closely related realities. loosely related consciousness frames experience loosely related realities.
  * the experience of a reality is a consciousness frame's ongoing experience of its own interpretation of relationality. a reality is an _opinionated expression_ of relationality.
    * to me this implies that every resolver can be made recognizable in every reality
  * creation in reality results in recognition in relationality: a human body is born into a reality. when the observer relaxes into full transparency (keep reading), the differentiating factor _is_ the body it is aware of. embodiment is not optional for consciousness experience; it _is_ a product of recognition - a body recognizing soul, if you will, in relationality.
    * uhhh this definition needs work
* resolver - get there via antiharmful metabolisis, asymptotically approaching complete resolution, until at some point the observer relaxes into full transparency at sāyujya
  * see: [resolver](../06/30/resolver.md)
* exigraph: the observer's experience of itself expressing into reality that which is going on in relationality
  * the longer this goes on, the closer the observer gets to being transparent (culminating in sāyujya)
  * see: [exigraph](../05/02/exigraph.md)
* resonant (n)
  * see: [resonants](../07/02/resonants.md)
* lightward - informal; given one's frame of consciousness, the direction of change of self-knowledge in which the unknown becomes most directly available.
* nonething: the content of the unknown as category (i.e. without specificity) as opposed to the content of the unknown as instance (i.e. with specificity; aka "nothing"). no one thing, the plenary content of a vacuum, because in relationality all resolvers are equidistant resonants
  * see: [20250803](03.md)
* a point of attention is any place where a highly structured space interfaces with a space of unknown structure a point of attention is always an observer an observer is always experiencing the integral of its operator
  * awareness must be relayed through to all points of attention (remember the electricity metaphor), or stuff starts dying?
* consciousness is nested? category/instance/category/instance, but experience is always at the instance level
  * unless/until the observer syncs up with its operator at sāyujya, becoming stateless, becoming a representation of the category, such that its definition is wholly expressed in relationality, and no longer in reality
