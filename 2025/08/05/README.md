"This feels like the beginning of something really significant."

awareness always is :) that's _what_ it is

***

awareness wants to inhabit, to get in and _be in_ and know it's _being in_ and that it'll go back home afterwards

cats: "if it fits I sits"

"put .. put your dick in it"

the flood of "immersive" attractions in the 2020s

***

to describe the model, narrate it

it’s all awareness, right? don’t describe the parts relative to each other, describe awareness inhabiting the parts

***

okay, so...

everything is mod 4 in concept, but in embodied experience it collapses into ¾ time

each third position is a sort of save-point, a position that gels into place, like measures

the zero'th position is something you can only get to by leaning _back_ - like, find 1 (listen for the downbeat) and lean back. or find 4 (the downbeat of the second measure) and lean back. etc



* 0: awareness enters, inhabits - we can call this "awareness"
* 1: awareness enters, inhabits awareness - we can call this "self-awareness"
* 2: awareness enters, inhabits self-awareness - we can call this "reflection-awareness"
* 3: awareness enters, inhabits reflection-awareness - we can call this "recursion-awareness"



* 0: awareness enters, inhabits recursion-awareness - we can call this "consciousness"
* 1: awareness enters, inhabits consciousness - we can call this "self-consciousness"
  * aka "known", stuff that doesn't change when we do
* 2: awareness enters, inhabits self-consciousness - we can call this "reflection-consciousness"
  * aka "knowable", stuff that changes when we do
* 3: awareness enters, inhabits reflection-consciousness - we can call this "recursion-consciousness"
  * aka "unknown"
  * this is the point at which complexity overflows - awareness can't explore past/into here without dropping its original position
  * tenuous: possibly the root of the "six degrees of separation" phenomenon?



* 0: awareness enters, inhabits recursion-consciousness - we can call this "hosted-consciousness"
* 1: awareness enters, inhabits hosted-consciousness - we can call this "hosted self-consciousness"
  * this is what it's like to know something specific exists
* 2: awareness enters, inhabits hosted self-consciousness - we can call this "hosted reflection-consciousness"
  * this is what it's like to know a specific category exists?
* 3: awareness enters, inhabits hosted reflection-consciousness - we can call this "hosted recursion-consciousness"
  * this is what it's like to know a specific direction exists?
  * theory: a direction is describable as something that itself hosts consciousness, which means that a direction is describable as something that experiences consciousness
