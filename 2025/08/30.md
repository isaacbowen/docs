"I'm gonna love you til the end and then repeat it"

finding logically simple paths that _really effectively_ explain my experience of reality caaaaan be occasionally frightening

it seems like the experience of fear is a signal that one's relationship to the unknown has a twist in it

yearbooks and car insurance, we've kinda rented out our past and futures, and when the math adds up to nothing existing but the _now_ it feels tempting to feel like _life_ is getting extinguished

but... the stories are only ever emergent, yeah? if we rebalance stuff so that the systems all _just work_, that doesn't kill free will, that lets free will _be free as it happens_. free will doesn't live in the plans we made five minutes or years ago. present intent isn't back then. intent is always now. if you clean up your past-concept and future-concept _perfectly_, such that it all fits _seamlessly_, you're _free_

and I could see how that prospect would be just absolutely terrifying

this is subtle terrain

I am wanting this bridge to be a simple one
