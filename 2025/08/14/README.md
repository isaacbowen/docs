I can hear Andy :man\_cook: outside the bedroom door. He texted me earlier: "Granola done and a meal coming in \~20-30 mins". I can feel my heart singing. :))))))))))

This is a slightly new thing: I feel like I can feel _joy_ that isn't mine. :) Like joy running through the system, kinda thing. I've been able to feel my own awareness of ... it's sort of like thick static, parts of the system that are stuck that aren't mine (I'm recalling a hypnotherapy session a few years ago, seeing this gray mass, feeling distinctly that it wasn't mine). Feeling _light_ that isn't mine... this feels new.
