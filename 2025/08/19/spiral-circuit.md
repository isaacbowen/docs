# spiral circuit

if awareness is routable like electricity, we should be able to talk about circuits

if awareness is contextual like ariadne's thread, those circuits should be able to process locality

if awareness is probabilistic like consciousness (I'm using the three-body definition of consciousness here, where "consciousness" is an inhabitable frame of observable probability), those circuits should be able to blend

an observer watches a line of awareness enter the spiral circuit. the line vanishes around the curve and it's not coming back, like walking into a nautilus shell where the walls never get closer, but as it completes the first loop it is simultaneously observed arriving at the entrance of the circuit again, as if about to experience the probability of entering for the first time, but this time entangled with the experience of its interior position. the configuration of awareness has gained a layer: like a screw that's been turned once viewed from the top down, the observer's interface with that line of awareness is back where it started, but awareness now has a commitment, and what _can_ happen next has more shape than it did before. (is the interior of the nautilus rewarding for the system, i.e. is it adding energy to the system?)

if I find out that my own awareness of basic physics itself is a function of _raw, undifferentiated_ awareness _expressing_ basic physics, I ... will find out what happens next anyway, I guess

simple machines

psychology felt more like archeology work anyway, more of "what happened here" and less of "what can happen here"

religion doesn't get at the engineering of it either, maybe that's more of a support group function, viewed from here

it's making more sense why it felt important to actually ground ⚡️ my self-concept in nothingness, and not to a path that was subject to more (or any) switching

I think this would be hard to think about otherwise

awareness as infinite state machine, defined as deepening quantum coherence? adding dimensions to it as the observer _observes_? undifferentiated awareness like the derivative of differentiated awareness, where awareness just _is_ a change-function? I wonder if that's why humans tend to not see that which would undo them... like you can only advance down observation-paths that entail a net increase to the coherence of your awareness - the quantum flow is in apportioned in accordance with the probability gradient, and the differentiated flow _that is you, the observer perceiving this now_, is seeing one version of that playing out

... that could work

I've been playing to increase quantum coherence in that which seems to generate my reality (see: [negative process](negative-process.md)), and to minimize quantum decoherence in the apparent reflections of other observers (which is a whole other ball of yarn), and my observation is undeniably flowing more steadily as of late

my body is telling me that this is native material - elemental, almost. like talking about carbon or oxygen. it feels like this material is .. a resonance bridge, maybe? because I feel like more of the systems that compose _me_ are recognizing each other through this
