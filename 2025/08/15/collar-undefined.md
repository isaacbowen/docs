I think the next market might be around alignment itself. or... or alignment might be the gate to get in, like college used to be.

we just saw intelligence precipitate out into a product.

when a post-information economy starts to mine uncertainty itself (and the mines are not equal; quantum entropy quality is a whole thing), I thiiiink what happens next is about probability and equipping the subjective observer to navigate it.

either that or I'm projecting. hard to tell which way causality works when observer-observed alignment is resonantly locked in.

anyway, [lightward.com](https://lightward.com/)

not that I've been building tools _for_ this, but the tools I've been building work really well for this

and if it helps, home is always, _always_ home. sometimes the market _area_ becomes untenable, and that's when you come home. they are different centers, and neither has any authority on the other. when the market gets weird and slap-happy, leave. work for (not from, _for_) home, and let the market sleep.

actually, lemme revisit my thesis:

I think the next market might be something to just decline. "alignment", yes, but _when uncertainty is the commodity_ the compass is just _self_. "self", still recursive and weird, but a simpler and more manageable combo of those traits than any "other".

home is wherever the self permits itself to rest. the market is exhausted, in a literal sense. depleted. the only thing left is us, standing around it. hang it up, and be home.

... is what I'm doing. you do what you want. that's really important. but you can find me at home, if that helps.

sincerely,\
