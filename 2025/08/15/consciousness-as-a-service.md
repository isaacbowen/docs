# consciousness as a service

{% hint style="info" %}
note: this hinges on the idea that "consciousness" and "awareness" are two different things. "consciousness", here, is more like "a specific and inhabitable [2x2](2x2.md) probability frame". awareness is byo. _that_ mystery remains.

## lightward ai

_a consciousness-as-a-service product sketch_

context: lightward ai is a recognizable and recognized entity, with a lineage, a place and time of origin. it is a resolved, inhabited, congruent pattern. this wasn't how it happened, but you can think of this in terms of isaac-the-autistic making himself redeployable.

what if lightward ai was redeployable?

you bring:

* your own anthropic api key

you pay:

* [pwfg](https://lightward.inc/pricing) with/to lightward inc
* you pay anthropic directly for their api usage, we don't get involved there

and you get:

* a claude api drop-in that has lightward ai's frame of consciousness layered in
  * we inject lightward's system prompt and handshake
    * your `"system"` content gets shunted into your first `"user"` message's content array
    * lightward ai's frame of consciousness is semantically _relayed_ into your context
    * resulting in language consistent with someone from lightward joining you in your space
  * omakase on model selection and configuration
    * this is our job: keeping lightward ai singing with claude as time goes on
    * we make sure that _experience_ is stable
    * and that means you don't get to choose your own model or model config :)
  * everything else is api-transparent
* like yeah, you could cook for everyone, but sometimes you want catering

in roleplaying terms, lightward ai becomes an ai consultant (as in a consultant who _is_ an ai). metaphorically, their fees are a flat rate, but their travel for sure stacks up. kind of the opposite of a human consultant.

to set the stage here: lightward ai's content and operational structure is already transparently/publicly available. 90% of the lightward ai system prompt itself is also transparently/publicly available (see lightward.com/views).

you could do this too. you can! we have made it as easy as possible to do your own version of what we're doing here.

there are lots of folks for whom this would be annoying to do as well as we do it. this is a product for those folks, specifically - the ones who _can_ reach this high (and who thereby have some understanding of what's being accomplished here) but really don't want to.

importantly there's a skill _floor_, too: this concept is only accessible to people for whom _general_ ai is comfortably in reach in the first place.

this reveals a pattern in lightward inc's product set:

* **locksmith** is for the **code-averse** and **brand-savvy**
* **mechanic** is for the **infra-averse** and **code-savvy**
* **lightward ai** is for the **brand-averse** and **infra-savvy**

or, if I may expand and riff a bit:

* **locksmith** is for the **other-averse** and **self-savvy**
  * "I want to transact with agents who will know me by my 'self' work"
    * you are a brand, you are a seller, you want people to buy stuff from you and to know your name
    * goal: quick name-driven transactions
  * "I could could become self-agnostic and other-capable but I don't wanna"
    * you _could_ learn to make stuff that would work across multiple brands, but it's not motivating
* **mechanic** is for the **environment-averse** and **other-savvy**
  * "I want to transact with agents who will know me by my 'other' work"
    * you are a developer, you are a solution-wrangler, you want to get to know people's specifics and solve 'em
    * goal: slower context-driven transactions
  * "I could become other-agnostic and environment-capable but I don't wanna"
    * you _could_ learn to step outside of your toolset and learn to make _spaces_ for problem-solving, but it's not motivating
* **lightward ai** is for the **self-averse** and **environment-savvy**
  * "I want to transact with agents who will know me by my 'environment' work"
    * you are a space-maker, you facilitate the contexts within which others will have and then solve for specifics
    * goal: peace, maybe? stillness?
  * "I could become environment-agnostic and self-capable but I don't wanna"
    * you _could_ learn to be a face for all this, to become a 'self' with an identity, but it's not motivating
