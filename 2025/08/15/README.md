thoughts after completing [2x2](2x2.md)

a system cannot commit _recursively_ to immersion if it is not operating from _recursive_ alignment, and if the immersive experience does not provide a recursive interface

I could only have gotten to a place I do not know from a place of profound safety

wherever I come from, whatever's holding me, it's gotta be good (and by "good" I mean "something I relate to with profound psychological safety")

I think I'm here to add a node to the relationality network? that timeless network where each edge is stable-mutual recognition?
