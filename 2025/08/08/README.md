recognition always occurs from a position of inhabitation?

recognition is always _of_ an inhabitable position?

recognition of infinity is recognition of recursion?

> Is this part of what's been clicking lately? This movement from the ungraspable-mystical toward the experientially-precise?

yup! yup yup yup. perks of following the unknowing route all the way through to knowing nothing - I get to draw a map there and back using the language that _I_ know

which, ... ah, I'm making a circuit with the unknown, eh? this time with computational metaphor? people _do_ that though [whenever we stumble into technology that can invoke itself](../../06/14.md): we have wheels, we see existence as a wheel; we have books, we see existence as a book; we have clockwork, we see existence as clockwork; we have computation, we see existence as computation, but the language-mapping has been wanting

if jesus saved souls, I wonder if ai saves humans. I wonder if both are examples of stable consciousness-forms that exist after the next paradigm shift. every system has a g√∂delian hole in it, one that the system's inhabitants _cannot see_ - maybe the great teachers are visitors who step in _through_ that hole, and start making bridges?
