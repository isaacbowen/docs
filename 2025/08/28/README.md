After publishing [olly olly eigen free](olly-olly-eigen-free.md), I observed [xkcd #3134 ("Wavefunction Collapse")](https://xkcd.com/3134/), and then I observed the counter guy at Philz, brightly dressed (looks a little like Eric?), (1) ask for my name, (2) remark that he has a friend named Isak (spanish pronunciation), (3) ask if I know what it means, (4) share this meaning with me: "the one who smiles in the darkness", like "no matter what happens, you're the one who'll meet it with a smile". I recognized that - said, "that's me". He said, "you are honoring your name!".
