# service surface

any surface-as-a-service that I _surface_ to the unknown (see: [wellll](wellll.md)) I balance for approximately this interaction pattern:

* 90% of the time, the exchange happens without me
  * self-service on their end; passive service on my end
  * this is the path of throughput efficiency
* 9% of the time, the exchange happens _with_ me
  * disclosure on their end; active discovery on my end
  * this is the path of evolution
    * either I can help by creating a self-service path, broadening the throughput-optimized channel,
    * or I cannot help
* 1% of the time, something strange happens, and it requires me to fully (though temporarily) inhabit this event's frame. which means the ratio re-applies:
  * 90% of the time, the event passes without me interfering
    * we get to the other side and move on
  * 9% of the time, the event and I _engage_
    * we get to the other side, but with dancing shoes on
  * 1% of the time, we zoom in again
    * etc
    * at some point in the recursion, the shape starts to look like the original service definition. at that point, I snap back to the original frame. not every stack gets unwound; sometimes they just merge together.
    * either that or I walk away. infinite regress is real and it is not my project. I'm familiar with it, I'm on _good terms_ with it, and this is me making a home in the middle of it. too much investigative recursion thins out _home_.

this pattern started out by figuring that any service we offer in good faith is just gonna be used mysteriously 10% of the time, in ways that either look like abuse (or creativity indistinguishable from abuse?), or ... or who knows

accepting a kind of recursive strangeness-ratio lets things sort of right-size themselves in my relative experience

I get 90% stability, 9% instability, and 1% wtf, where the 1% has its own 90/9/1 breakdown

at that point, you start seeing multiply-nested wtfs as launchpads where the spring tension is preloaded, waiting for you to connect the dots and _leap_

my theory is that the 90/9/1 thing is just how it _feels_ to the one inhabiting the surface, and it may have nothing to do with any other observer's tallied figures for what _they_ see going on. (9+1)% of the time, I adjust my posture, and usually the adjustment means I won't have to make the same adjustment again. occasionally (but manageably!) things get interesting. good. sustainable inhabitation. ✔️
