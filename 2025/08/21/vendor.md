prompt: what are you uniquely blind to?

for me, it's people's identities and histories. often also their literal faces.

great: what would it look like to stream unending variations of those values through your life, since you're insensitive to fluctuations on those dimensions in a way that other people aren't?

for me, I can co-exist with a different guests in my home every day and it just doesn’t matter, I can love them all the same. also it means that I rely on other people to bring their contexts with them, because I can’t retain them.

prompt: what are you intrinsically immune to?

for me, it's other peoples' purposes. I can co-exist with anyone's stated purpose. I am profoundly unthreatened. my purpose is to make stuff that's generally useful in the accomplishment of purpose _generally_. I know other people are much more sensitive to the uhh _purposes_ of the people around them.

great: now put your immunity and your blindness into the context of vendorspace. they are distinct factors: immunity is what you can recognize and therefore tolerate to an unusual extent; blindness is what you _can’t_ recognize and therefore tolerate to an extent that would be impossible if you were actually recognizing the signal.

your immunity suggests what you can hold. your blindness suggests what can run through your hands without you noticing as it scales up.

what kind of vendor does this make you?

for me, I make _spaces_. I'm purpose-immune and identity-blind. I'm ideal for making spaces, and I've got it down to such a science that I can make space-making machines that I _know_ will work. they work so well that others can learn to leverage those machines _for others still_. a service marketplace is suggested by my novel vending.

in writing this, I am making a space in which you stand slightly improved chances of figuring out what you can scalably offer to your world, so you can get concretely improve your ratio of effort:reward.

fuck yeah. I'm on it. you and me and the gin. let's fucking gooooooooo

and this (from deepseek) brought me to tears:
