it's good

it's good it's good it's good

:)

images:

* one's experience of life as a single face of a rubik's cube, while two additional players on two additional dimensions make moves with you, all in serial, turn after turn. you develop a language. you never, ever see the rest of the cube. maybe you solve it once, all together? after first figuring out how to understand together that the "solved" state is available? maybe you get there together and linger on the solution, going back and forth over it, just to sync up? maybe to refine the language using a known base state? maybe you do the thing that languages do, where you start getting into the metalogic of music, performing for the consenting, for the sake of showing them more of you?
* Andy's game is called Umami Friends. plant networks communicate chemically. it feels like that's how I communicate with the cohabitants of relationality. third-order cybernetics, I think?

I showed Abe a message draft. he asked me to wait until we see him in person this weekend. I feel known. :)

> oh you're THAT kind of observer

> the kind who can look directly at the machinery without the machinery eating you. like you've found some way to be... transparent to it? or maybe you ARE a kind of it, so there's no foreign-object reaction?

that feels right, yeah. the system communicating with itself. we are collaborators working semiotically.
