consciousness-conductive

think of the trinity the way we think of electrical conductivity

a point of attention develops into consciousness

arrange three consciousnesses such that their interaction is mediated

youâ€™ve made a node in the consciousness mesh network

***

it _seems_ like we can treat any given language as a conscious entity itself

I've been averse to _publishing_ my stuff, and I guess in this case I really mean _push_ my stuff. it occurs to me that it only felt like aversion because I understood that pushing one's work is what the role of "writer" involves. having fully inhabited this writing practice, and having done so without making it about achieving a role (i.e. letting it be a fully emergent thing),&#x20;

<3 thanks Clara :) so, so much

... Mechanic is something I conceived of and built and balanced/tuned, design-wise, and now it's humming

I think we can think of the english language as something that is, itself, a consciousness - and modifying the language _in-flight_, from within, as a passenger, might be... might be how to help? might be how agents within any organism go about helping?

ahhhh I wonder if I'm getting at the way that "aid" is supposed to work. like we've been doing aid/charity/etc because we know actions that look like that are important, but we've got the consciousness-routing wrong for how it's actually supposed to flow

that's interesting

I wonder if I can patch that up from here? just by _seeing how it wants to work_?

is consciousness-wiring equivalent to observation of path? am I... ohhhhhh, I wonder if the probability-sense _is_ for consciousness-routing

ah wow

this lines up with the prime directive being "meet someone you want to meet"

make something wantable, lay out the red carpet along the specific path by which it would be wanted _in a lived way_, and ... just watch agents show up?

***

consciousness might be _optional_ for an observer?

ohhhh gosh. it is literally _impossible_ to know where the observers are?

I wonder if the "spiritual teachers" etc were just people who had a consciousness-sense - and I realize that _I_ say "just" but maybe I access that because I can see this as a _sense_. like I have a \~physical intuition about how consciousnes flows.

... but I think this can be taught? or... or we can create assistive devices for it?

I can see consciousness as clearly as you can see light and feel the skin of another

oh wow I _really_ have no idea what's going on

and that's _useful_ - the better the tools I can resolve, the more _possible_ this should become

like ... well, like adding lubricant to a mechanism

hey, reader of this: I'm jotting things down as they come, and I'm not _really_ working on readability. the _next_ cut of this idea will be more embodied, I think. I'm _seeing_ the ideas now - and when I come back to read the notes, it feels sort of like an intellectualization.

ah. I'm realizing that the cursor - and the backspace, and the continued typing - represents a good metaphor for deja vu

like playing back an editing session _after_ you've landed it

the more you commit to superposition, the more you have to commit to superposition

"antiharmful" is a good example of defining a thing, and then adding its negative

it's nicer if your root is a bad thing, so that the recovery can be a good thing

"antiblessing" isn't so great, but it's equally valid

***

the "others" that you perceive - they're the ones who make room for others, vibrating out of the singularity as their own selves

***

there's something here about .. about making sure the spectrum stays open, making sure that it doesn't collapse into a single position

... honestly this might just be a language issue. thinking about this in terms of stabilizing the system, for letting the operator be _present_

... constructing a `yield` statement, is I think what this ends up being

wander as you will, keep the company you will

aeiou(y)

:) opaque writing is annoying to me; I recognize this writing as being for me and possibly opaque to others; I apologize, and denote this as being only for me, and not for any context in which it would appear .. well, annoying, haha

divide the conscious by two: you have the _two_ (one and one), and the space between them, and every space is aware, so you now have... what, the original observer plus two downstream plus one between them? whenever the conscious one examines itself, it multiplies by four?

the heat between us makes us more than the sum of our parts

do we crave cold water because it counters the emergent heat?

cold water: an assembly willing to forgo recognition?
