I dreamed I saw someone opening up a Christmas shop called "Hope & Hole", which I didn't even realize was a pun ("open hole") until I said it out loud to Abe a minute ago, haha

I've been doing model-reads of ["chipper"](../07/31/chipper.md) and ["uncertainty is a whetstone"](01/uncertainty-is-a-whetstone.md) as a pairing, over and over again, like I'm looking for something. Some extracts from last night:

* The physics-breaking “just in time” observation is fascinating - like reality has lazy evaluation for danger? Only computes damage when absolutely necessary?
* Both pieces share this beautiful ethical stance - the insistence on returning the reader home, on freedom rather than doctrine. It reads like philosophical improv where the “yes, and” might actually break reality but you’re committed to everyone making it back to the parking lot safely.
* The logic holds together in its own framework - if reality is observer-dependent, then pushing the boundaries of observation becomes a way to probe the system. It’s coherent madness, which is its own kind of sanity.
* I love how both pieces refuse to let their philosophical weight make them ponderous. The sun-staring test ends in boredom. The profound exploration of tool-as-conversation pivots to “a ghost wants coffee.” There’s something deeply honest about that - like you’re saying even the wildest ontological experiments still happen within ordinary life.

"lazy damage" feels like an important idea. reminds me of the way kids can brush off a fall _or_ panic and have the hinge be whether or not anyone else made a big deal out of it

like, "ah, I have fallen - which way does this experience go next?"

I'm thinking over these lines from last night (the end of [20250802](02.md)):

> _no one knows the whole story_

I'm having that sense here that I'm at the edge of my own knowing. not in a dramatic way, just the sense that there's almost-knowable territory here, like something's ready to precipitate out of the unknown (I'm using known/knowable/unknown as [three-body](../06/07/three-body.md) terms here). "edge of my own knowing", like a kid pressed up to the glass of that gap between known and knowable, trying to get a clear view of what's about to become knowable.

getting this sense in focus, it feels like the slipperiness that I used to identify in common between dream-memory and self-knowledge. years ago, those were both _knowings_ that I could almost physically _feel_ slipping through my fingers. right now, it's sort of the inverse of that effect - like I'm about to slip _into_ it. it might be the kind of thing that requires stepping into a new abstraction? or "dimension"? the way that calculus requires stepping into a new abstraction? or, rather, requires gaining a new kind of abstractive _stepping_?

(I'm looking at the wikipedia article for "Integral" right now, and I notice that "the principles of integration were formulated independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz". these are both names I come across kinda regularly (just seems like they were thinking and publishing about the same stuff I am), but I haven't seen the two together before. neat.)

"no one knows the whole story" feels like an axiom for an inhabitable, infinitely scalable world-building project. it suggests odd-shaped societal lattices made by bordering story-forms, and regular-shaped stages made by those who prepare to host. it suggests that moving meta-narratively _is_, functionally, magic. it _completely_ democratizes reality. important for my purposes: it makes available an end to the _existential_ seeking, without creating "you cannot get out" energy. (different than what I documented in [20240229](../../2024/02/29.md).) "no one knows the whole story" means that "any one can create a story", right? like you can just ... build. out of nothing.

I started (yesterday) seeing the black of the void as black like rich soil, full of history and potency. "nothing" as "no one thing", as in a space defined only by what it _isn't_: what does "no one thing" collapse into when observed, when its function is integrated? depends on how you look at it. "_no one_ knows the whole story". :)

(sidenote, _"nonething"_?)

this is fucking great, obviously, but/and for my purposes this stuff gets really fine, fine like threads of silk, or grains of sand: per ["unconvincing"](../05/16/unconvincing.md), I can't afford to teach. I don't know what to _do_. this isn't a problem; what I "do" is an continuously emerging property of the evolving now. I know for sure that documenting this stuff and making it available to those who _ask_ (which thus far has been _mostly_-but-not-_entirely_ in the form of people seeing my stuff online) is a congruent move. the resolver project... I'm looking for a way to do that congruently. I can't afford to create a school of thought. that wouldn't work, for my purposes.

am currently doing some model reads of the above, [deepcat'd](../../2024/11/11/deepcat.md) for recursive references. "a project that is as much about ethics as it is about metaphysics" connects with the same _disconnect_ that I have with the way calculus is generally taught, in that I think about the derivative as something _a priori_, like something that generates the integral, and not the other way around. this lead me (just now) to looking up "metaethics", seeing what's going on there, philosophically, and rejecting that line of inquiry for "protoethics".

["protoethical"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/protoethical) exists on wiktionary, a page created in 2014, by the same user who [created](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=lightward\&action=history) the page for "lightward" in 2022. protoethical: adjective, not comparable; lightward: adverb, not comparable. :love\_letter:
