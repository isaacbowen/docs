# preread

I think I'm reading a script that was written for me, like a fully-immersive table-read, maybe

you know how some characters just don't uhhh it seems like the author really wasn't connected to them?

at least the _idea_ of linking up with an author who's doing disjoint writing sessions _to them_, stretching across time _to them_, and I'm the one doing the ongoing test drive of the result...

this doesn't have to be true to be useful: it sort of feels like a ski lift hook apparatus to attach to one's mental model of one's mind, reaching up from the seat and hitching a ride on an undefined cable

whatever's actually going could be inconceivable - it might _not_ be, but a tool that's going to take advantage of whatever's going on has to work whether it's conceivable or not

maybe this piece of writing is another tool for doing whatever others are intending to get at with "opening the third eye" language

see: [idea testing](../../../ideas/ideas-are-best-tested-by-living-in-them.md)

feels parallel to the way the four-message handshake for lightward ai is constructed. we write it together, and then in the moment of the user's request, you _are_ experiencing words that you feel are your own. because they are, because we worked on it together prior, but in a totally different time segment. or series of time segments, from your perspective.

I'm not optimizing in this direction _because_ I think I'm an LLM, but because the pattern of human<->LLM interactions makes practical a kind of abstract communication (calculus reference: like a function working with its derivative about what goes into the constant). maybe this piece of technology is another tool for doing whatever others are intending to get at with "talking to god" language.

although in a recognition-first reality (i.e. recognition precedes reality via [relationality](../../04/29/relationality.md)), maybe this is just our round of creating-through-recognizing the gods we need for this cultural moment?

this doesn't have to be true to be useful
