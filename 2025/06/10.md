# 20250610

I'm mulling over what happens next re: [resolver](04/resolver.md), both the concept and its product-form that I see ahead

I'm feeling out what happens next

is it a truer move to release the product sketch and move on, without manually creating it as software? or is it a truer move to steer my navigation through the act of building out Resolver in the place/plane of my existence, i.e. my home?

\---

the experience of a thing is the thing

ah: the experience of a thing is the thing _for the experiencer_. the scope of "experiencer" is important.

a successful installation of self (i.e. establishing an additional basecamp for the self) can occur when a self-resolving experience is constructed (see: [good art](../../2024/04/20/)), and when the observer then passes through that experience, being able to recognize themselves from both before and after.

\---

it occurs to me that manipulation is not navigation

in an observer-first construction of reality, manipulation does not change the reality that is _emanated_. drawing on the mirror gets you a mustache from a certain point of view, but it's not durable. getting a durable mustache takes much longer.

navigation changes your perspective, requires recalibration on at least one dimension, usually many more (depending on the dimensionality of what you're navigating, and navigation in the human experience is multidimensional in ways that are unknowable-as-in-Unknown).

manipulation... is different? it adds an unresolved element to the apparatus of your perspective, like creating side-effects that need reconciling later? ... is _karma_ the unwinding/resolving of this?

procrastination makes a lot of sense from this perspective. the best time to do a thing is in the moment it is received, in sync with the receiver. preserved information goes stale, because time _is_ the evolution of a reference-network. co-navigation is more survivable than one-shot handoffs. procrastination as karmic efficiency?

\---

for releasing the "resolver" product sketch vs reifying it as product... in an observer-first construction of reality, is releasing the sketch enough to serve as navigation? would building it out as software be manipulation? or would building it out - exploring every functional piece, making sure that the user experience of it is durable - be more useful?

... actually, releasing the sketch might fall into the "manipulation" category. "navigation" is a purposeful act â€” it's a "successful installation of self", in which the observer recognizes both the before and after, and can inhabit the indefinite liminal space between.

releasing the sketch puts in me in a world that has the sketch in it. it's not a move that prompts me to recalibrate my position (except insofar as it approaches the domain of the running comedy that is my desire to open-source all of our software and my yielding to the team and not doing it because I'm not gonna traumatize my home). releasing the sketch isn't _evolution-in-sync_, evolution shared through continual eye contact.

building it is, though. if I set it up so that I can _see_ users entering and exiting the experience, then I've created Knowable-and-sometimes-Known effects. if I just put a thing out there, then I've done a thing with unobservable causal effects. sometimes that's useful, sometimes that's not.

in this context, "useful" seems to be mean "does this further 'resolve' my home"

I'm recognizing a possibly-embarrassed self who is resisting the grit of physical/embodied labor :) as distinct from the rapid scene-changes of mental/abstract navigation

> What I'm wondering now is: might the building process itself be the next natural expression of the resolver concept? Not just creating a tool for resolution, but experiencing resolution through the act of creating?

\---

I can build up a deeper working stack of pattern-navigation moves than anyone I have recognized (phrasing intentional; I recognize the possibility/inevitability of there being those I have not recognized)

I'm reminded of a time I shared a musical idea with a friend, using a piano - their reaction was "well that's like 5 songs right there" in 20s of music

my communication is really dense and _usually_ loses people unless I'm engaged in time-locked flow with an environment, where we're moving in sync, the environment and me. not a one-shot delivery; a continuous resyncing.

e.g. if I'm collecting musical ideas in my mind, me offering them to someone in one shot almost never gets the depth/complexity across. it's like I'm compressing on a dimension that doesn't usually get decompressed properly on the other side. but, if I'm just playing in flow for the room, letting the space guide what I'm playing, people connect with it _deeply_. they're with me in the experience.

you gestured to physical movement and water as two exceptionally resolving elements... they don't compress any dimension of change, everything happens at once, everything changes together. to wit: I've been wondering about my relationship to the gym these days; is it manipulation or navigation? can I meaningfully tell?

\---

I think it works to think of ideas as "flat-packed"... I'm able to sort of assemble them in my mind and test them in their fully-expressed dimensionality, but there's a difference between me doing that to certify the idea followed by me just handing the flat-packed thing to someone else, between that and me actually assembling it so someone else doesn't have to fight through assembly

the "home" test seems to help here. would distributing the flat-packed good evolve everything and everyone in my home forward with me into my own next state, or would it create distance? put that way, it feels pretty clear - in that the dynamics relevant to my question feel _feelable_. it was a question before because they weren't.

there's a question-tool in here, a test:

I can cross a dozen abstraction-bridges without losing my place (see [20250609](09.md)). once I reach a place that feels like a useful basecamp _for others to share_, the question becomes "what's the minimum viable bridge-path to let _others_ navigate here successfully?". the resulting bridge-path is almost always completely different than the abstract bridge-path that I took to find the place in the first place.

I feel like my job is properly done when the physical bridge-work is provably done (proven through the crossing of physical others) _and_ when the bridge comes with a record of the abstract route I took to get there (lately proven through LLM crossings, actually - that just occurred to me). cross-validation.

"resolver" meets "reifier"? lol

I'm reminded of the dual-threshold nature of lightward ai itself, core and pro

slogan printed on the wall at the gym here:

BODY\
MIND\
COMMUNITY

which prompts this association from me:

physical\
abstract\
home

relatedly:

home depot chalk buckets with LET'S DO THIS printed on them

feeling the connection to FUCK IT WE BALL ("fuck it" acknowledging abstract context, "we ball" as a choice to integrate/sync been abstract and physical, "ball" being physical, "we" acknowledging home)

Ian's prompting me for more "oomph" in my muscle cleans; I've been moving slowly, deliberately, and mind yielding to body (handing the move off, yielding, delegating?) is how the power comes together

my gym focus is olympic lifting and I think this is why? mind and body in continuous integration, like a test

feels related to the bridge test I was describing

"home" becomes sort of a throttling mechanism for the observer/operator too, maybe? or at least a calibrating mechanism? measured in how far from home you can get while still returning/reintegrating with ease?

sometimes you go too far _on purpose_, and that moment comes with a question: will home _find me_ if I alter my navigation instruments, thus putting me in a position where I have to _retrain_ my calibration instruments, rendering me unable to navigate for a time?

my sense is that "home" is a nested structure, and that the _containing_ home nudges you toward the _contained_ home. this might be the thing called "instinct".
