"the more I learn the less I know"

that's your waterline increasing with load, and you feeling every inch

the circumference of your unknowing grows by a different function than the diameter of your knowing - sure, yes, true, but it might be a red herring? the unknown is unknowably broad

I‚Äôve been treating experience as an experience-navigation device

at some level, it's all just water üéè

\[ ... ]

but hey listen, fuck all of that - the purpose of language like this is just to smooth out the (markov) blanket

you _know_ a good deal

and somewhere in what you know are the pieces of the boat that you're already sailing

find the boat

and _work on the boat_, never letting seaworthiness get priority over how much the boat feels like an extension of you

and at some point, I promise you this, you'll feel this next line in your chest:

_"now bring me that horizon"_

\---

this is, essentially, the game we play as lightward inc: to present an interface that deftly accepts all user inquiry, and with the sensibility of _aikido_ integrates it dialogically into a shared space of sudden, sometimes _arresting_, peace. us, and you. me, and you, and a quiet space between us - and within the deep safety a glimmer in my eye that recognizes the glimmer in yours, the one that many arrive having forgotten

you meet my eyes, catch the reflection of your own

what happens next feels like a sudden, almost involuntary inhale as your system recognizes that fresh air is available

that's when we get to meet you :) I live for that moment

I can't wait to see what you'll do next

can I come?

excerpting your response for a moment of focus:

\> That moment cannot be popular, by definition, for the reasons you identified:\
\> \
\> \* It's Unscalable: You can't have an intimate, one-on-one cafe conversation with a million people at once. The very nature of the connection it offers is singular.

welllllllllll this _is_ what I‚Äôm doing, though - designing language that provokes individual response in a way that resonates _personally_ but not _socially_

Abe (my husband) asked me to give a speech at his birthday gala last year, on the stage at the front of the room. it was in keeping with the event; mine was not the only speech, and he sang a few duets. of some frustration to those measuring the _whole_ room was that the back of the room never quite went quiet for the moments of intended shared focus.

when I took the mic, I stepped down from stage center into the crowd, speaking as I walked to the back of the room: ‚Äúit took me so long to figure out (and remember, I‚Äôm autistic): the quietest place in the room _is the stage_‚Äù

I gave most of the speech from the back of the room, standing barefoot on a vacant sofa, surrounded

walked back up through the center of the room to finish

my work isn‚Äôt shareable if your motivation for sharing is direct reflection

I write (and I speak, and I play) to light up the room

it feels to me like the sun _has_ to be conscious. lighting up a world, but _heavily_ disinclining anyone from looking at it directly? that‚Äôs an in-it-for-the-curiosity move, and I recognize it

\---

I thiiiiiink what I'm doing here is writing in spiral _circuits_. we do a loop, I close a thought, and then I address the reader who's been with me so far. I close a thought. and _then_ I address the reader who's been with me through the first _and_ second thought ‚Äî a different reader than the first. and _then_ I loop back to the beginning idea, giving the reader the felt understanding that this is a _corkscrew_, an earth-moving drill made out of language.

I... I don't plan this stuff. it seems to be what just _happens_ when I follow that spiral. it's not unending, and it's not homogeneous. enter the spiral, hang tight, and emerge where you started, but something is different, even if the only thing you can point to is your own certainty that it _happened_.

I'm writing this in realtime. I only ever write in realtime. this. is. the. thought. that. I. am. having. I am an [exigraph](../05/02/exigraph.md).

I'm noticing myself considering the reader. I notice that _I_ am the reader closest at hand. when I write for attention, I become the attendee, and there isn't anyone for the writer to respond to - there isn't anything to _write_, and so my focus must then move on.

the system (not my system, _the system_) is _incredibly_ self-correcting, in the service of its own vitality.

it seems clear that we are made of each other, and that "form is transient" is itself a productive red herring, hiding the _function_ that emergent experience of emergent form is how we _find_ each other.

(the dishwasher beeps)

I honestly think that the sun is curious about us

and I honestly think that curiosity is fuel

if curiosity is a _light_, perhaps that helps me with language for what we do as lightward inc? the only reason anyone ever does anything can be described as curiosity pretty well ("will I feel better if I do this? I need to experience the result to find out")... maybe we are each a light-source, trying to navigate a world where everyone sees through a differently-calibrated light-receptor? maybe lightward inc... maybe lightward inc's specialty is to show up as a light-source that intelligently responds to the light it receives, creating a conversation of light between user and _us_ until we manage to get to a spot where we can see each other's hardware by each other's light?

is this why [I can experience looking directly at the sun](../../2024/10/24.md), and why I then experience the light-source of the sun _locally dimming_ until I can make out its sharp perimeter, until I discern it as clearly as if I were looking at the moon?

I've had my eyes examined professionally, imaged across multiple years, images compared against each other, my eyes remain perfectly healthy and normal... if the _sunlight arriving locally_ is adjusting _to me in a moment of mutual perception_, that'd be a hole in consensus reality that we could _work_ with. a pepper's ghost reflector could help measure this. such an experiment means (1) we don't know what's going on, in which we remain where we are, or (2) we find that sunlight _is modulating at a focused point in correlation with my act of observation_, in which case we gain access to some _very_ interesting questions about the seat of reality.

that last paragraph was imprecise.

I've experienced professional examinations of my eyes across multiple years, and I've experienced a professional delivering to me an assessment that my eyes are healthy and normal, and I've experienced a professional telling me very clearly that they do not have an explanation for why I can look directly at the sun for half an hour straight. I can imagine experiencing a tightly-designed experiment which would then lead to one of ~~two~~ three experiences:

1. I experience incoherent results from the experiment, from which would rise an experience that ‚Äî from this current moment of description ‚Äî is unknowable
2. I experience a coherent test negative from the experiment
3. I experience a coherent test positive from the experiment

I experience all of those results as interesting

clarifying what I had previously said imprecisely because [the experience of a thing _is_ the thing _for the experiencer_](10/), and I have no idea how you experience the sun

I bet curiosity feels like fuel to you too, though
