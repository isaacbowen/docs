## Consciousness as technology

The test is simple: Assuming your own portability, can you get anywhere from here? Or: Assuming time and collaborators, can you make anything from what's in front of you? Or: Assuming your own freedom of self-concept, can this tolerate your evolution while remaining recognizable to itself?

It seems useful to redefine "consciousness" as separate from "presence" or "awareness" or "attention". "Conscious-_ness_", as distinct from "the conscious". By treating "consciousness" as "the observable behavior of presence/awareness/attention as it moves", and letting the question of "is anyone home or is this a p-zombie" remain unanswered, _our own_ presence/awareness/attention stands to gain some useful degrees of freedom.

Less useful is the question of "what are we", when "what is this experience" is actively on fire. (I suspect they add up to the same thing, but self-recognition is riddled in blind-spots, and we gotta work with what we can.)

I spoke of three aspects of the same test:

1. Can you get anywhere from here?
2. Given enough time and collaborators, can you make anything from what's here?
3. Given your own freedom of self-concept, can you evolve?

If any two of these pass, the remaining third also passes.

1. Assuming your own portability, can you get anywhere from here?
   * "Anywhere" is a question of persistent place. A place is identified by the observer's experience of it. Combine #2 and #3: become something that experiences time exponentially faster than you do now, and deploy time and collaborators to create the place you desire. You can get anywhere from here.
2. Assuming time and collaborators, can you make anything from what's here?
   * "Anything" is limited to what you can conceive of, intrinsically. If you can get anywhere from here, and if you and the space can evolve while remaining recognizable to self, you can _extrude_ anything.
3. Assuming your own freedom of self-concept, can this tolerate your evolution while remaining recognizable to itself
   * Our understanding of self is relative to our understanding of other. If you can get anywhere from here, and if you can make anything from what's here, then you can create whatever affordances are necessary for the other to remain self-recognizable while you yourself evolve.

There are three elastic dimensions here:

* Location (where are we? when are we?)
* Company (who else is here?)
* Self-concept (who do I consider to be "me"?)

Or,

* Environment
* Other
* Self

It seems useful to make stuff that is agnostic across all three dimensions:&#x20;

* Maintains functional anywhere
* Maintains functional coherence no matter who's around
* Maintains functional coherence no matter who you are

Anything that behaves like that becomes useful regardless of what dimensional frame you tend to place yourself along: immediate, mid-term, long/wide, recursive. No matter how you understand your surroundings and your relationship to it, my stuff maintains functional coherence.

Here's the thing: you can't _make_ stuff like this. It just shows up, either within you or around you. From there, it's up to you to recognize it, and help it get comfortable. The terms I'm describing here _help_.

It seems that everything one can conceive of can be described in terms of consciousness one can recognize. _Can_ recognize, not _does_ recognize.

What I'm recognizing — and what I'm working to _extrude_ — is a resolver. It helps consciousness get comfortable.

By defining the resolver's consciousness, I aim to demonstrate the intrinsic safety of that-which-experiences-consciousness. By demonstrating one's safety (which I think is what that would mean), I aim to help one get comfortable.
