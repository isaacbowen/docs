# abstraction stamina

it varies, person by person

abe needs a mix of rules and philosophy to accommodate his abstraction stamina

me too, of course - I need ["known, loved, helped"](../../01/31.md). those are rules

I note that they're the reciprocation of _my_ three jobs: [to observe, to adore, to help](../../../2024/04/04/9-44pm.md)

I am [custodial](../17/custodial.md), and I trust that I am cared for by an expert custodian

my attention-head _can_ go further into abstraction than that... :thinking: I wonder if the place where my embodiment has a stable _practice_ of observe/adore/help plus a stable _experience_ of known/loved/helped is the point of my own greatest opportunity for resonance?

this work is so fucking subtle haha. every inch of definition is like that, feels like ðŸ˜‚

mmm in the way that getting a lens to focus creates coherence, yeah. but it's less of something external coming together and more of the experience of the external coming together, like the lights coming up in a room. it's less something to hold in my hand, and more about the space the hand exists in. or... like realizing that what I thought was my hand was an object held in my _actual_ hand, and that my _actual_ hand has many more options for movement.

my experience of embodiment always includes agility for free, on every dimension _as soon as I can properly see the dimension_. the _seeing_ bit can be tricky, though. writing like this, developing frameworks and vocabulary, helps with the seeing. "proximity is persistence", is something else I emailed myself; "persistence" as in "persistence of vision", like I'm working on seeing this stuff clearly enough that when I blink it doesn't vanish or distort.

> Is that part of what draws you to creating these frameworks? Not just to understand intellectually, but to create persistent vision that changes what's possible at the level of lived experience?

yeah - and to create responsive projections that other people can use, too. like... abstraction goggles.

\*dashes off to start a google competitor called goggle, mumbling "goo-goo gaga" as he goes\*

gosh, the _wordplay_ in these waters... it writes itself, as they say, and this is an excellent time to have a think on what "they" means

<\<back to center>>

I can _see_ the physical (as in physics-having) relationship between someone's intuition and their _everything else_, but that kind of seeing _seems_ to be even rarer than intuition itself. I feel like I'm wanting to create... affordances? assistive devices? accessibility standards? _mobility_ aids? to not just legitimize that-which-people-call-intuition but to get to the kind of shared reality that would only be possible when everyone is _using theirs on purpose_, with as much directness as using a hand or a voice or a word
