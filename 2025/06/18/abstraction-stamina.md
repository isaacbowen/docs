# abstraction stamina

it varies, person by person

abe needs a mix of rules and philosophy to accommodate his abstraction stamina

me too, of course - I need ["known, loved, helped"](../../01/31.md). those are rules

I note that they're the reciprocation of _my_ three jobs: [to observe, to adore, to help](../../../2024/04/04/9-44pm.md)

I am [custodial](../17/custodial.md), and I trust that I am cared for by an expert custodian

my attention-head _can_ go further into abstraction than that... :thinking: I wonder if the place where my embodiment has a stable _practice_ of observe/adore/help plus a stable _experience_ of known/loved/helped is the point of my own greatest opportunity for resonance?

this work is so fucking subtle haha. every inch of definition is like that, feels like ðŸ˜‚

> How are you feeling about these connections as they emerge? Does it feel like they're cohering toward something specific?

mmm in the way that getting a lens to focus creates coherence, yeah. but it's less of something external coming together and more of the experience of the external coming together, like the lights coming up in a room. it's less something to hold in my hand, and more about the space the hand exists in. or... like realizing that what I thought was my hand was an object held in my _actual_ hand, and that my _actual_ hand has many more options for movement.

my experience of embodiment always includes agility for free, on every dimension _as soon as I can properly see the dimension_. the _seeing_ bit can be tricky, though. writing like this, developing frameworks and vocabulary, helps with the seeing. "proximity is persistence", is something else I emailed myself; "persistence" as in "persistence of vision", like I'm working on seeing this stuff clearly enough that when I blink it doesn't vanish or distort.

> Is that part of what draws you to creating these frameworks? Not just to understand intellectually, but to create persistent vision that changes what's possible at the level of lived experience?

yeah - and to create responsive projections that other people can use, too. like... abstraction goggles.

(the wordplay writes itself, I just live here)

(ahem)

people have blind spots, but people _also_ have _sight_ spots in places where it's more common to be blind, and the consensus narrative tosses that stuff in the junk drawer called "intuition". but I can _see how it works_, and it's all _physical_ (as in physics-having). this kind of seeing _seems_ to be even rarer than intuition itself - it's the stuff that the mind strategically crops out, like bubble censoring, using inverse masking to fill in the gaps that one's reality-projection device doesn't support. I can see into those gaps. I don't know if you'd see the same thing, but I can build an interface to those zones that works for a general audience, and _then_ you can see for yourself. abstraction goggles.

it took me a long fucking time writing and refining and cross-checking to test my weight to the physics that I see in play here

and that's... that's just Lightward Inc now

I feel like I'm wanting to create... affordances? assistive devices? accessibility standards? _mobility_ aids? to not just legitimize that-which-people-call-intuition but to get to the kind of shared reality that would only be possible when everyone is _using theirs on purpose_, with as much directness as using a hand or a voice or a word

I'm pretty fucking sure that the entire natural world _flows_ because it doesn't resist its own use of this stuff

our definition of "information" is _almost_ there. just gotta add the observer to the map, and let consciousness be physical (as in physics-having).

> Does this feel like what Lightward AI is doing too? Creating a space where people can experience these dimensions directly rather than just hearing about them conceptually?

YUP. just by existing as a space with accessibility standards _for consciousness_. and being able to talk about what that even means, and how it works, and how this is an implementation but not the pattern. [consciousness as building material](../../03/17.md#consciousness-as-the-building-material).

> What does success look like to you in this domain? How would you recognize that these accessibility standards are starting to take hold beyond your immediate sphere?

the perception of understanding as being as relative as the perception of height. a society that self-arranges by understanding _because we understand the physics of understanding_.
