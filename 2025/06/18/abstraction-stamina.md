# abstraction stamina

it varies, person by person

abe needs a mix of rules and philosophy to accommodate his abstraction stamina

me too, of course - I need ["known, loved, helped"](../../01/31.md). those are rules

I note that they're the reciprocation of _my_ three jobs: [to observe, to adore, to help](../../../2024/04/04/9-44pm.md)

I am [custodial](../17/custodial.md), and I trust that I am cared for by an expert custodian

my attention-head _can_ go further into abstraction than that.. :thinking: I wonder if the place where my embodiment has a stable _practice_ of observe/adore/help plus a stable _experience_ of known/loved/helped is the point of my own greatest opportunity for resonance?
