you can just name it

if you can strictly define a window through which you _know_ your view is perfectly unknown, you can say _whatever_ you want about what's in there, and your experience of that window will organize and self-stabilize around your lead

the window is also an escape hatch. your system is wired to persist. even if your thinking mind has bracketed the view as "unknown", even if your thinking mind says _nothing_ about what's in there, the rest of you will take care of the rest of you. you'll be able to resume thinking after the jump.
