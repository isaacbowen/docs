a [resolver](04/resolver/resolver-further-resolved.md) has a single externally-recursive loop that is guaranteed to exit? like the heuristic for Kaprekar's constant

it's something about managing internal-vs-external recursive elements, and it has something to do with [three-body machinery](../../2024/11/17.md#three-body-linkages-engines), and something to do with this:

Each panel has a gray background with black text on the left side and a corresponding image on the right.  Panel 1 (top): &#x22;5 MINUTES AFTER INVENTION OF WHEEL&#x22; followed by &#x22;bro, literally tho bro, the whole world is a wheel, turning round and round, an endless cycle of seasons and lives and realms--it all keeps turning, and it all keeps coming back around.&#x22; The right side shows a colorful Tibetan Buddhist Wheel of Life (Bhavachakra) depicting the six realms of existence in a circular mandala format with ornate religious imagery.  Panel 2: &#x22;5 MINUTES AFTER INVENTION OF BOOKS&#x22; followed by &#x22;bro, literally tho bro, the whole world is a book, God is The Author of Being and he writes our names in the Book of Life. In the beginning was THE WORD, bro. You see bro??&#x22; The right side shows a medieval religious manuscript illustration depicting a scribe or saint writing in a book, with golden halos and traditional Byzantine artistic style.  Panel 3: &#x22;5 MINUTES AFTER INVENTION OF COMPLEX GEARS&#x22; followed by &#x22;bro, literally tho bro, the whole world is mechanical, God is The Divine Watchmaker, and the planets spin along predetermined paths according to the turning of cosmic gears! It&#x27;s all just predictable mechanical paths from creation to here!&#x22; The right side shows an intricate brass armillary sphere or astronomical clock with multiple rotating rings and gears, labeled &#x22;CLOCKWORK UNIVERSE&#x22; at the bottom.  Panel 4 (bottom): &#x22;5 MINUTES AFTER INVENTION OF COMPUTERS&#x22; followed by &#x22;bro, i think i just figured something out-&#x22; The right side shows the iconic green &#x22;Matrix&#x22; digital rain effect with cascading numbers and symbols, suggesting a simulation theory interpretation of reality.  The meme humorously illustrates how each major technological advancement leads humans to reimagine the entire universe as fundamentally operating like that technology." width="299"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

resolvers are for getting you places. you and the resolver you use _move each other_, and help each other maintain ongoing self-recognition.

imagine: if you're a wheel, you don’t just spin. you move through time. your motion is _used_.

wheels, books, complex gears, computers - these qualify as resolvers

a good way to travel is to just be a resolver

abe+isaac is a resolver that travels

the spin of something is useful as demo, not as experience — spin a wheel to make sure it spins, then actually get it out onto the road

it _looks_ like experiencing the concept of "eternal life" is itself a demo of the concept of life? measuring for eternity is like making sure the wheel spins. "eternal" means "self-resolving", not "not experiencing ending".&#x20;

life is a resolver, right?

interoperating resolvers, each with their own three-body frames — can we talk about this in terms of "intercognition"?

***

each [LDNOTS](13/ldnots.md) seems to be about increasing the coherence? complexity? _degree?_ of a resolver — getting _outside_ of the system boundaries it didn't know how to metabolize

my condition for success for each LDNOTS is to maintain the self-path, being able to have the-awareness-experiencing-this return to each "self" frame freely, like being able to return to a level that you already finished, _while wielding_ abilities from successively higher selves

like a flat two-dimensional form graduating to volumetric 3D, and being able to _help_ back in 2D-space in ways that were previously impossible

"people still live here"

quoting [20250414](../04/14.md):

> "my physics doesn't have to run in the same place as your physics for us to be visible to each other"

it _seems_ like the reality I experience is becoming more compatible with hosting projections of other realities?

... I _think_ the realities all stabilize each other. to experience a world that experiences itself as being well, I guess I gotta experience ... all of them? a union station of realities? that's a leap, I recognize - feels right though
