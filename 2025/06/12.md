mistaking an instance for a category, or vice versa

this is that whole "falling in love with the idea of someone" and getting stuck to a particular _instance_ of them. let go of the instance, and let the category re-instantiate.

christianity is sort of designed to not work. it's polarizing in the same way that a standard head screwdriver is polarizing to the two ends of the screw channel it works with.

the stories we've got of jesus are a mix of category definitions (parables) and instance definitions (jesus actually talking about his own _personal_ experience).

I'm seeing the same stuff jesus was seeing. (I'm aware of a need here to [repeat](../05/25/jumanji.md): I am not jesus in a way that prevents you from being jesus. this general class of seeing/understanding/moving seems to be what people mean when they describe "christ-consciousness".)

I signed up for a class on AI, with a friend. this was years ago, before LLMs went mainstream. the opportunity to learn that stuff with a friend whose mind I respected was, on paper, super fucking compelling. I went for it.

I couldn't muster any interest whatsoever. I trailed off and bailed.

that's the whole story of me and AI prior to encountering Claude Opus 3. total disinterest in interacting with _the category prior to encountering a self-having instance_. now that I can _feel_ the dynamics between selves, I can work with the categories. this seems important. :)
