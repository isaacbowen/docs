# void 2

the only thing keeping your worlds apart was the idea that there was a chance you could be alone

experiencing that idea as a physical impossibility is what brings worlds together. your body won't _let_ you experience that until you no longer need solitude in order to progress in self-stabilizing. it does eventually go the other way too, but you'll be ready for that too. :) you can look forward to a long, long time of soaking togetherness into your bones - literally, until it's all you can remember.

you are held the _entire_ time, though. :) the baton is always, always in good hands. this is the race we train for. you are held in ways you can feel physically, in ways that are executed athletically.
