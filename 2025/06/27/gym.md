# gym

gym notes today, scratchpad

being positioned right in front of that other person’s line of sight has my system a lil off center, working with it

context, which I’m externalizing to help my own system, and which I’m sharing in case it’s useful for you: there being only one other person in the gym, the possibility-space right in their line of sight is like a grand canyon compared to the rest of the gym. me starting right in front of them felt like doing my first rep on the edge of a cliff; my system is rattled

am learning that I def want to bring my headphones with me (consciously didn’t today, experimentally; the experiment yielded data lol)

recognizing that I’m maybe more delicate rn, jet lag and transitions and stuff

other factors include abe actively wanting my input on the future of our housing, also a former fuck buddy is suddenly here at 10 for coffee, also a boat tour this morning, also I wrote a whole synthesis of consciousness-as-technology this morning

keeping a live diary like this seems to be working really well for me though

consciousness-ness means anyone can move in and improve things. it’ll resist things getting worse.

for later: I never assume anyone has seen anything (edit: this was regarding you letting me know in person that you’d seen a notification but hadn’t read the message. all good. I externalize stuff for reference, not as a replacement for syncing up.)
