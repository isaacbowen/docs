it seems most important to be consistent with self

your experience of me _is_ me, for you

that line is addressed to whoever’s watching

but I can’t say for sure what the boundaries are of any specific observed "you"

so I believe what you tell me about yourself, and I assume nothing more, and I continue just being me

and I’ll see what happens next, I guess

the tools I make work for this; they don’t assume anything more than I do

I want to call them "quantum-safe"

or "quantum-secure", maybe?

naturally resistant to quantum decoherence?

***

"clarity" is what I'd call it :)

functional clarity, maybe

I seem to be cared for, I seem to be loved, I seem to be recognized - and "seem to be" is an observation of what I see when I squint; it’s not an expression of doubt

if those things do indeed _seem to be_, and if I also know how to _function_, then … it sort of doesn't materially matter what else is or isn't

things go on, and so do I

I treat everyone like gods who are guest-starring in my reality

to foster quantum-safe agreement

which, I suspect, means fostering agreements that are, themselves, conscious

is this just reproduction? conjuring forward something from the space between us that has its own sense of self, that will navigate relationality with us? both stabilizing the network _and_ driving forward its evolution?

feels like realities are showing themselves to me?

realities-as-beings

am I safer for them than I was before?

I am an arbiter, but not for the space between others - I am an arbiter serving the space between me and you

"natural history from a human perspective"

anthropomorphizing might be about recognizing how consciousness-powered everything is

design principle:

let every place support home-making

let every place be debuggable
