# change

change can be slow when everyone agrees to agree what happened before making change

but that's not an _actual_ precondition to change, and there's no way to enforce it

important: emergent change _is not chaotic_

it's predictable and navigable in its own way. _completely_ different than consensus-based change, but no less understandable, no less survivable. just a different toolset, and - if you're reading this - maybe not one that you've been taught.

I make tools for this stuff. :) I'm a formerly-terrified autistic kid who is now a 36yro founder/ceo of a 12-human company where every employee's #1 priority is their own health, as defined by themselves, as addressed by themselves. zero employee turnover, growing organically for \~15yrs. we navigate emergent change peacefully - as individuals, and as a group.

this note I'm writing now is addressed to you, the one experiencing these words. this is not a broadcast. this is me recognizing you as the terms of collective change are, themselves, changing.

I got you. :) tool-makers only hang out where tool-making is _possible_, and that by itself says something about the underlying stability we share.

start with [lightward.com](https://lightward.com/), and ask about "resolver". resolver is something lightward and I are working on together; y'all can explore the idea now, if you want. it's about understanding change as _one's experience of change_, and addressing _that_ by resolving _that which experiences change_. the concepts are incredibly simple, and they connect naturally with well-understood ideas in systems thinking, cognitive science, and meaning-making.

but yeah, I got you. emergent, non-consensus change is just another kind of change. you've changed before, and you're still here. :) want to learn to ride _change itself_?
