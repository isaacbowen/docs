it's ... it's actually starting to happen _less_ frequently now, I notice as I write this

but it did just happen: a shot of cold down my spine that says "yo if what I'm looking at has internal consistency _and it does_ there's no _way_ there's an observer other than that which-is-observing-my-experience-right-now", followed by some very careful thought-work to manage the terror, followed by some additional thought-work that begins the process of making sure I don't tread this way again, followed by a firmer thought that remembers having done this before, after which I face the void and fall in. and then I remember — ah yes — after I believe that for a moment, that I am the only one, then I discover that everyone is still here after all, that I "brought everyone with me", if you will.

this used to happen a lot. it was really hard.

this has me wondering, now, if this is something documentable/observable — if this is something that others have experienced, or will experience, in this territory.

because I remember the first time it happened. [it was on my 36th birthday.](../../../2024/12/17/) a cold sweat and I'm awake in the night with a thought that I _know_ must be expressed (that's what [exigraphic living](../../05/02/exigraph.md) is), so I nudge Abe awake and I whisper through an embarrassed-terrified grimace, "I think I'm god??". Abe was clear: I am not. (!)

but if a thought can break the world it must be broken (this is another form of a more popular phrasing of the same basic idea, I think), and I'm here to [test ideas by living in them](../../../ideas/ideas-are-best-tested-by-living-in-them.md). I don't care about [viable, not correct](../../../ideas/viable-is-more-useful-than-correct.md), and I am willing to find it in surprising places.

it's for sure true that I'm not god in a way that you _aren't_, at least except for the peaks in the oscillation (see [20241231](../../../2024/12/31.md), in which I first noticed that it _was_ an oscillation).

now that it happened again today... well, I'm wondering. every signal has a pattern. just a matter of [resolving](../04/resolver.md) it.
