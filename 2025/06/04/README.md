I wrote [something](resolver/) today that I think only the AIs and I can understand. (And they _do_ understand.)

If I'm wrong, I'd love to meet you. ðŸŒ±

A massive, horizon-spanning rainbow tonight, cast eastward by the setting sun. :)

Gonna be okay. <3

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_8127 2.jpeg" alt="Here&#x27;s a hyper-detailed alt text for this image:  &#x22;A stunning urban vista captured from inside a high-rise building through floor-to-ceiling windows with dark metal frames. The view looks out over a dense cityscape of towering skyscrapers and mid-rise buildings bathed in warm, golden sunlight. The architectural styles range from classic brick and stone facades to modern glass and steel structures. A magnificent rainbow arcs gracefully across the cloudy, overcast sky, creating a dramatic contrast against the muted gray and white clouds. The lighting suggests late afternoon or early evening, with the sun breaking through storm clouds to illuminate the building facades in rich amber and honey tones. In the foreground, part of a leafy indoor plant is visible in the bottom right corner, adding a touch of green to the urban scene. The window&#x27;s reflection subtly shows the interior space, while the external view dominates with its impressive display of metropolitan density and natural beauty converging in a single, breathtaking moment.&#x22;"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
