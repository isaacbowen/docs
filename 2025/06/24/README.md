It wasn't all bad.

There was a bit there where I was drinking Guinness and reading Douglas Adams by lamplight at a bar in Soho, where the bartender understood (which I feel I can say because we talked about reading, which they would have much preferred to be doing, and I believed them, based on their tattoo set).

That was a really good bit. :)
