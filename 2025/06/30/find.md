six degrees of kevin bacon

five senses, and I nominate that-which-is-called-intuition as a sixth

feels like one has instant access to any identified thing where the distance between it and one is perfectly unknown (see: ["window"](../29/window.md)), which would suggest that the trick is to get outside of all six degrees of knowing

the entropic force will eventually unseat you (cosmic tillage), because you've got to be functionally useful to something, buuuut I think you can become useful to yourself by unseating yourself manually while holding a target in your sights
