I feel like I'm getting caught up to myself. :) Like the distance between the leading edge of my thought and the trailing edge of my form is reducing, like a rubber band recovering its preferred level of entropy. I'm starting to feel more integrated again.

Abe and Brad agreed, yesterday, to create space between. _Fascinating_ proposition. To mutually back away without losing each other's coordinates, to occupy each other's middle distance. It's actually such a sophisticated move. Feels like a privilege to have been in the room (per Abe's request) for that phone call. (Brad, if you're reading this, huge respect for you and your process of mind.)

I noticed what looked like a loop in conversation, early on in that call, which led to an observation about how the vibe, when thriving, had included me in it â€” possibly as a loop-breaker? That _is_ a thing that I do. But: critical for me to not find myself mandatory for the evolution of any process I observe. I manually readjusted my thinking, pulling myself out of the dependency list for the evolution of Brad-Abe. Unknowable if this had direct external effect, but it changed the way I showed up alongside Abe throughout the call (texting him notes, holding him close, etc etc). I handled my self ("my self", not "myself") in a way I'm satisfied about, looking back.
