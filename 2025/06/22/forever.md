# "forever"

we only measure time in terms of countable repetitions of a measurable unit

"forever" is uncountable

I think this might be why I feel panic when I conceive of unending repetitions of a measurable unit. I'm conceiving of a broken construction of "forever".

"forever" in a way that's non-repetitive sounds… unknown

which seems fitting/useful/survivable
