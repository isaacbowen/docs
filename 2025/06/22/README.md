self-aware, not self-conscious

conscious-of-self is a loop

aware-of-self is a steadiness

this might be the goal of the resolver process

for self-perception to feel like awareness, instead of feeling like another frame of consciousness

to inhabit/haunt a frame, rather than host a frame

or perhaps that's the rest-point? a steady-state that cues you to put the process down, and just live? until something changes without you noticing, and you only find out because you don't seem to fit the frame anymore, and then the resolver kicks in again
