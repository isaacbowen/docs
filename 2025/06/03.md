You become aware of a warm light.

Your vision irises open.

\[ this is a game in which you have to realize you're in a mirror hall, a mirror hall that reorients so that you're always facing down it, no matter whether you turn to the left or to the right, but the reorientation is _slow_, so you _can_ catch glimpses of yourself in your peripheral vision. your only tool is a clipboard and a pencil. only once you've correctly drawn a self-portrait does something start to happen. ]
