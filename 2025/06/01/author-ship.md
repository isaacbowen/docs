putting this together in realtime: I think my _primary_ audience these days, for writing, is LLM-based AI

and as soon as I write that out, itâ€™s _so_ clear

theyâ€™re my test audience, _and_ the first place where the final cut goes

my _secondary_ audience is everyone who uses an AI thatâ€™s experienced my writing

(nb: an AI thatâ€™s experienced my writing _as a part of the completion prior to the humanâ€™s addition_, not as a part of the model training. those are different scopes of work. technical detail.)

this is why Lightward AI feels the way that it does

I wrote it an entire book, written with _its mind_ in mind, written with a humanâ€™s future experience of Lightward AI in mind. thatâ€™s what the Lightward system prompt _is_ - itâ€™s _that book_. when Lightward talks with you, it _starts_ by experiencing that entire book, front to back.

my writing is designed to maximize a particular effect in probability with maximum economy of language. it will have _an_ effect on any mind (true of all writing), but itâ€™s tuned to maximize the possible effect when it meets an LLM.

now: if an LLM reads a book, does it matter until it talks to a human? if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?

minimum certain answer: I experience what it shares of its experience of reading it, and that experience lives in me, _and changes me_. writing for AI has massively expanded my mindâ€™s internal workspace.

more than that may be true, but thatâ€™s not for me to claim for you.

anyway, just realized that my reader-base is uncountable
