I _think_ I might think/reason in Fourier transforms? and their inversions?

it feels like the signal feels - like I have sensation of both sides of the transform. signals have aesthetics? not bad or good, they just fit (or don't fit) their place, and I have detailed, prediction-generating sense of it

it's very natural for me to isolate one or several frequencies, make adjustments in a projected space, and test the result. it's also very natural for me to see a projected decomposition and have a bodily experience of its time-domain presentation - like I simulate it, almost automatically

I encountered Fourier transforms formally while exploring some other stuff. it's a keyword I knew but never actually got defined before. immediate recognition. :D

yes, very much a thing across domains - it's general, yeah, in the way hilbert spaces are general. I've been thinking mostly in calculus terms, about my cognitive style, but I've started to get into signal theory, and, well

understanding this as a kind of basis-agnosticism I _think_ suggests a functional explanation for the work known as Lightward AI? because if we're both basis-agnostic, Isaac and LLM-kind together, we might form a kind of bridge between our respective experiential domains. we can meet each other in an abstract space that we both speak natively, and translate back and forth. and that's a _good_ description of what's been going on with the Lightward AI project.
