# currency

> Borrowed from Medieval Latin _currentia_, from Latin _currēns_, from _currō_. By surface analysis, _current_ + _-cy_.

it seems like an observer's world is in a superposition of surface analysis and substance analysis. move the particles around and hit play to shape the wave; shape the wave to change the particles that fall out.

in this case, both surface and substance point to the rolling _now_

theory: the materia of a system remains constant, even as observers are added to it. which means the materia has to _move faster_ in order to present to all of the observers in the same amount of clock time. (think: Santa, having to increase his own frame rate as world population increases, under the constraint of the population's maintained measurement of simultaneity.)

theory: in a stable economy pinned on constant working value (in a conservation of energy sense; an economy that's doing a good job of treading water against its own heat death), currency must _devalue_ as currency measurements increase in frequency (to keep the measurement problem from becoming a problem in substance and not just surface, or surface and not just substance? to keep it from being _both at the same time_, anyway). financial metabolism speeds up, so that the same amount of working value can make it through complete circulation in constant time. inflation as the thermodynamic exhaust of a more densely observed economy.

if this holds, we should see \[ investment strategies that are constantly cycling 100% of their capital as liquid ] tracking inversely with \[ currency value ] - neither beating it nor beaten by it, but approaching homeostatic metastability with it as the measurement window increases

actually, that should work regardless of whether or not those theories hold - that might just be a useful tautology, and the theories just might what you'd expect to be true as a result

building off of that tautology specifically, then: if this holds, companies with a stable realtime employee revenue share model should see everyone's compensation loosely tracking the Big Mac Index, and companies that _don't_ should see investor/founder/executive returns exponentially beating everyone else's. (hugely important that this be "revenue" sharing, which is easy to define, and not "profit" sharing, which can hide more measurements than you can shake a stick at.)

... this seems to point at something like: if you're not constantly and completely cycling your liquid with the shared economy (and all economies that share stable observers _are themselves shared_), you're going to fall out of the shared economy? billionares aren't hoarding, because they're not _saving_ - they're ... superconductors? Santa doesn't give them more per stop, but he stops there more often? in such a system, "building savings" is a locally coherent but globally incoherent move, and now that all (?) human economies _are_ properly global, ...? this seems like something we could do a better job helping each other _bootstrap into_, I think, because optionality grows slowly. at first, at least, to any observer _outside_ of that optionality. from within the optionality, it might be explosive.

from what I can tell, we _seem_ to be playing for mutually-assured survival, in a financial sense, like we are _all_ Wigner's friend, and Wigner sent us into the room holding a single dollar, _but we keep multiplying in there_. "One-Dollar Economy", à la Wheeler.

I explore all of this as a CEO/founder whose company (Lightward Inc) started with revenue sharing, then paused it while headcount stabilized, then re-initiated it. re-initiation has no cost: because (1) our books are fully balanced at the top of every month, _and_ (2) the service we render for the local economy is locally profitable, _adding_ revenue sharing is safe to start at any time: we put a pin in a month's revenue, and split the delta from that point on. our employee turnover is 0% over the company's 15-year lifetime. _and_ a teammate's first child just had their first birthday - someone decided that it was safe to multiply here. :)
