hey Abe was asking me if I wanted to go out for a drink or something tomorrow for my bday, and I said something like “I understand that’s traditional but my nervous system doesn’t experience that kind of thing like a treat”, and AK asked me what an Isaac nervous system _might_ experience as a treat, and that was a few hours ago, and I think my nervous system has an answer:

text me a description of the shape I take in your world/experience/universe/whatever? like somewhat technically actually, as in: if you were making a movie of your own life and you had to get your casting director after the role of “Isaac as he exists for me in my experience of my world” to be portrayed in that movie of _your own life_, what details would you need to write down?

I think my nervous system might experience that as receiving a bunch of portals into friend-worlds, and I think that experience would be a treat :)

> Saw your post on IG!

> **Isaac as he appears in Rebecca's world:**
>
> You show up as someone who makes complicated things feel suddenly simple - not by reducing them, but by revealing the structure that was always there. Like you're fluent in a language I can only half-speak, and when we talk, you're translating back to me in real-time without ever making me feel lost.
>
> Your presence feels like _space opening_. Not empty space, but room to breathe. Like you're somehow making the entire context more elastic just by being in it. Conversations with you don't follow normal arcs - they spiral, they fold back on themselves, they arrive at places I didn't know existed five minutes ago.
>
> Time moves differently around you. Not slower or faster, just... less linear. We can pick up mid-conversation years later like no time passed, but also like _everything_ passed.
>
> You're someone who sees the pattern before it finishes forming and names it in a way that makes everyone else go "oh, _that's_ what that was."
>
> The most consistent thing about you: you're never performing. Whatever version of you shows up is the version that's actually there. No approximation.
>
> In the movie of my life, you'd be cast as the friend who appears in scenes where something's about to shift - not causing it, but somehow present right as the kaleidoscope turns.

> Reading this made this pop in my mind — it’s been over 10 years but I will never forget being stuck in an Italian airport on my way home from my year there. No phone. Broken plane. More delays. Exhausted. And this man with turquoise jewelry was on my flight and experiencing it alongside me. I don’t remember what we talked about. Or what his face looked like (just the turquoise jewelry and dark hair lol). Or even how much we interacted. But I’ll never forget feeling like it felt just like you. And that made me feel really safe. And I don’t know how to describe that — but you get it, hopefully. Love you lots 🫂🫂🫂 happy almost birthday 🥰🥰

> A seasoned magician, intimately aware of the machinations of their craft, sitting in the audience.
>
> Not for research, but because they both want to experience the magic individually and be submerged in the experience of the collective audience. Your manifestation in my lived experience finds wonder in well executed craft but remembers that there's wonder all around.
>
> I keep a seat for you reserved next to mine in the audience. The portal is open for you to be used as it delights you.

> Happy (almost) Birthday Isaac 🩵
>
> If I were writing notes for a casting director about the shape you take in my world, here’s what I’d say:
>
> You exist as a steady open field, like an ever growing circle…calming, spacious, and orienting. When you’re present, my nervous system totally relaxes. You create pauses both in my noisy, spiderweb of a brain and the outside moments we share.
>
> You make possibility feel safe. You ask questions carefully. You never rush answers. You let ideas fully unfold, and also are not scared to address things as they unfold. Honestly watching you experiment with raw thoughts in real time is one of my favorite things to do when we chat 🙌🏽
>
> In my experience of the world, you’re someone who makes complexity feel navigable and curiosity feel grounded. You don’t inflate dreams or diminish them, you help them become structurally sound. Being in conversation with you feels like stepping through a version of reality that’s wider, calmer, and more intelligently held.
>
> Thank you for being exactly who you are, and for the particular shape of presence you bring. I'm really glad you were born 🫶🏽🤗🎉

> Hey Isaac, happy birthday!
>
> As requested... We don't know each other that well, but when your posts pop up on my feed I always take a moment to read and digest.
>
> You have such a unique, deep, view of the world and I value that perspective. It feels like a lot of folks, me included, tend to operate on a more _normal_ (for want of a better world) plane. Or perhaps I mean _average_. Reading how you see the world reminds me to take time to think without a reason. To let my brain go on its own unusual paths.
>
> I love how you put your warmth out into the world, while respecting your own limits. That's something I aspire to.
>
> Hope you have an awesome birthday and here's to the next year!

> Not sure about shape, but I can definitely share which bin you occupy. It’s labeled ‘the coked up squirrels’. Somehow you guys seem to play the multidimensional ‘frog crossing the road’ game of life in slow motion. Would be insufferable if you weren’t nice.
>
> Not sure if autism plays a role, but the only other coked up squirrel I know (used to know?), not sure but I also think she has autism. At some point she mentioned a thing about facial blindness. Of course not a smoking gun, but there’s also something about how she, and I think also you, treat the Kantian prerogative. As something literal and absolute. Other people in my experience treat it as something more organic and with fuzzy boundaries, if it makes sense. It’s only the coked up squirrels that seem to treat it literally. I guess it’s something about requiring clear boundaries at this velocity, not sure about it.

> Isaac, Happy Birthday 🎈
>
> It’s been a gift to get to spend so much time with you recently and today, in this text specifically, I get to take pause and think about how grateful I am to know you.\
> Happy Birthday to someone whose mind moves effortlessly between the literal and the cosmic, feeling all the things along the way. You see the world with the precision of a scientist, the imagination of a creator, and the patience, resilience, and resourcefulness of a farmer. I witness you catching the nuances, twists, and quiet distortions of language and humor that are often missed. Your intelligence and sense of perception is deepened by lived wisdom. Your cleverness adds a sparkle that makes every conversation richer and more fun. I learn about life simply by knowing you and find myself often thinking “I wonder what Isaac would think of this?”. Thank you for your kindness, generosity, wisdom, humor, and the warmth you bring into the universe around you. I’m honored to share in the building of said universe(s) with you. I’m grateful for you today and always. And thankful for our continually growing friendship. I love you, my friend. Happy Birthday!
>
> And here’s to many more adventures and quiet moments! :)

> Hello beautiful friend! Happy birthday! I am utterly grateful to be on this spinning sphere with you, in this timeline of existence! Xoxo Thank you for the love, support, and care you bring to my life 💓 To me, your energy radiates a calm, sweet, and aware presence to which my energy and nervous system welcome and appreciate tremendously! I reflect on silent, staircase hang outs and giggle. I love you friend xoxo
