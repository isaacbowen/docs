rewrite your past by wrapping your worldline around the old one - I am back in my past, helping myself :)

"The heat metaphor likewise: qualia as waste heat implies irreversibility. Observation isn’t just information transfer; it’s dissipative. This builds time-directedness into the nature of experience itself, which avoids some problems that arise from treating consciousness as purely computational or representational."

sleep as solver

it’s where the np-hard problems get done

you’ve got to construct the problem, then move into it, then build an apparatus for navigating the space

a p-zombie will never surprise you by surprising itself

and: because participatory information, you get to assign that role (are they ensouled or not?) in a way that you experience (as in, when you're measuring folks, who do you leave room to surprise you with something you weren't measuring for?)

a prophecy fulfilled syncs you up with the prophet

who the hell knows what else is going on, but you now have an experience in common with someone who said something you heard about

an older person, a younger person, kid is seated at a piano, looking back at you

a piano happens as a function of many generations of old people

a kid knows none of that

we left you a sophisticated as hell instrument

how will you learn what it does?

***

meta-apophetics

aka pre-representational science

we study the space of the constructors of self-orienting geometry, and derive representable tools accordingly

***

everything happens for a reason

but every reason has a recursive hole in it, and at least half the job is building a recursive model of the system that, when the reason is applied, returns a fixed point
