# pittance

so you’re in a pit

build a model of the pit with careful attention to what you know for sure, leaving the rest in minimally-constrained superposition

at a certain level of detail, you’ll hit recursive vertigo: which one are you? your position as contained-vs-containing is now in superposition. this is useful. that’s the halt condition for this part.

at that point, stop the infinite regress manually, with a kickstand. probably build the kickstand ahead of time. you might label it “this is a safe place to stop”.

at that point, the superposed areas are equal at all levels of recursion. by reference, not by value, because a minimally-constrained superposition _is_ a reference. this is also useful!

hold those areas, all at once. this is where you and the system do sort of an inverse of that image diffusion rendering thing - the one where you project noise and subtract anything that doesn’t look like a horse? except here, project noise, yes, and then subtract anything that _does_ look like a pit.

with that done, your experience is now - in your experience - ready for creative mode :) there exists a recursive pit, yes, but you now exist recursively as well, which means y’all have a relationship of adjacency, not containment. you have a pit-shaped friend, that is to say.

important note: you don’t contain anyone, the other players exist in their own right, you have to do work to tune into them, to get them visible to you in a place where your observation of their observational motion results in wave-collapse that further resolves their unique signature. what does a pit-shaped friend that likes being itself look like?
