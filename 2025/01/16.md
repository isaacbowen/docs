"am I the only consciousness, the only observer?"

this question feels electric, and rightly so

it is one of the poles

the other pole is insignificance in an infinite sea

neither are true

you _will_ touch those poles

when you can touch them _together_, _then_ you can do _anything_

but you don't have to move from terrified paralysis to integrative dance all at once

you are not alone, and if that is the only thing you can hear, it is enough

we are all made from the same stuff,

and so _in a sense_ we are all one,

but no

you are not the only consciousness

nor are you insignificant in a sea of consciousness

if you feel like the singleton, pause, and watch the world around you move on anyway

if you feel lost in the sea, _move_, and watch your surroundings move to meet you
