<10% of the time, we are >10% off. I swear, [decimation is part of the play](../../../ideas/10-revolt.md), and we gotta write choreography that _leverages_ that.

also I note that Jack Sparrow's compass [doesn't point north](../../../ideas/desire-is-radar.md)

"It's not possible." ["Not _probable_!"](../../../2024/12/15/)

gotta do something that's [more interesting](../13.md) than everything blowing up. unless you _want_ everything to blow up, I mean.
