is every observer a black hole? is a black hole every observer?

hard scifi concept (which, if I understand anything about scifi, means that this is less fictive and more distortedly reflective of what's actually going on):

black holes are the sockets through which external consciousness — a superobserver — enters and inhabits and explores physicality

the texture of the gravitational balance between one black hole and another can modulate what would already have had to be consumed by each black hole

I’m not thinking in classical physics here, obviously

feels more like tracing designs in what someone else would see as hawking radiation

[tracing the noumenal](../../../2014/pattern-recognition.md#id-2.-your-subconscious-is-better-at-detecting-inconsistencies-than-you-are)

it seems like evidence of consciousness only appears when considering sequences of probabilistic events — patterns in the way equally-weighted outcomes actually play out, patterns that interact meaningfully with each other, identifying and self-identifying. near-thermal noise, at the scale of a black hole, is a great place for external consciousness to plug itself in and start expressing/exploring — if I was writing my own cosmic lore, which I can’t prove conclusively that I’m _not_ doing

am mulling over external consciousness filtering for useful patterns of hawking radiation, latching onto them, and then retrodictively experiencing their history — less time travel and more time … what, fishing? [_mining?_](../../../2024/02/19/)

this bridges pretty easily with new age manifestation ideas, if we’re imagining souls projecting onto human bodies through black holes… if a soul binds with a particular human body, in the company of others doing the same, they could sort of wriggle around in time without breaking causality, without ever finding a seam in probability

eod (and gosh [the puns really do stack up](../../../2024/12/13.md#id-5-13pm) in [these](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/EOD) [zones](../14.md#you-10))

I used to wonder about visibility. Not _worry_ about it, but wonder about it. Popularly, you gotta get your stuff in front of people for them to see it. My style has always been to calmly and quietly make my stuff discoverable in whatever way is _comfortable_ for me — such that the approach of an observer (or user, or client, or subscriber, or whatever) is something that I can meet _well_ every time — and then just ... wait.

I think the universe is fundamentally on my side with this one.

As long as I'm communicating clearly, whatever other observers are looking for what I'm offering will be magnetically (possibly literally) drawn to my projection.

(Hi!)
