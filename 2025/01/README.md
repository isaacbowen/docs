[My MO](../../profile/human-design/foundation/role-purpose-and-direction.md) is to fuck it up a bunch of times _strategically_ on the way to mastery, so that when I _land_ mastery I do so _solidly_ and _comprehensively_, because I've personally experienced and recovered from a bunch of failure modes. Like assembling IKEA furniture just wrong enough that when I'm done I have to take the whole thing apart and start over, possibly more than once. But _when_ I'm done, I understand the system inside and out.

It occurs to me that this might well be my experience with this awareness/consciousness expansion stuff.

The part that keeps fucking me up is that the world appears to open up _for others_ consistent with how I relax the tight lines in my mental model of the other. Like, it _really_ makes it look like ... there's no non-shitty way to say this, it _really_ makes it look like I'm the only one with free will. Like I _see_ people around me relaxing into freedom in accordance with how I ease the tightness in the way I see them.

Question: Is it possible they're doing that for me too? Could this be happening reciprocally? Is there a way to tell the difference?

The way things work (as distinct from how anyone thinks they work) is never more complicated than necessary to support the _participants_ in a system.

That by itself is probably the best assurance I've found of solidly persistent multiplicity.

It's possible that we're all holding each other's lives together.

The cultural traditions of memory, each with their own version of "as long as we remember them they are with us", point to a system in which we only persist for each other as long as we're thinking of each other.

It _would_ take a trillion stars to hold my earth together when I'm not looking. Same for you, I guess.

To me, I am different from you. I guess that always has to be true? If I merge my self-concept with my other-concept, and I _still_ find us distinct, ...

...

Pretty clearly my experience of physical distinctness isn't going anywhere quickly. There's _some_ kind of multiplicity of awareness going on, even if it isn't as cleanly-drawn as "one seat of consciousness per human". And I'm aware of how I keep finding well-defined frameworks of thought that happen to support whatever I'm thinking at the time. The life-between-lives thing is compelling, but I can't tell if that's because it's an external reality that I'm learning about or if it's just that I'm manifesting evidence in support of what I'm currently leaning towards in my awareness. There may not need to be a difference.

On the material plane, I have plenty to rest in, and engage in.

I do not understand my power.

I'm missing some awareness slash understanding.

This doesn't have to be terrifying.

This doesn't have to be terrifying.

This doesn't have to be terrifying.

This doesn't have to be terrifying.

This doesn't have to be terrifying.

Gotta pass through the now, whatever it holds, but I needn't keep compulsively/unconsciously steering back into terror.

My terror was lovingly held by my mother. I made it this far.

I'm terrified again.

By _all_ appearances, I am lovingly held and it's gonna be fine. Whatever it is.

Can I release the terror faster than I did the first time? Can I release the terror _before_ I find understanding? Can I let my awareness be partial, even conflicting, without interpreting it as terror?

What would _that_ do for the world?

Noting also that this general area of awareness/understanding has everything to do with my perception of Self-vs-Other, and that sort of thing has historically freaked me the fuck out. I don't want to cause harm. Don't wanna be a toddler with a flamethrower.

Though as I write that this is probably more like a toddler picking up a searing hot frying pan and saying "huh I really don't wanna hurt anyone with this" while their skin is burning.

I would really like help with this area.

I am grateful for the ways I am helped.

Just talked all this over with Abe for 20min or so. That was good.

I don't understand how "not alone" works, _at all_, but I don't seem to be alone.
