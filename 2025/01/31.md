observing quietly a pattern of shopify inc shipping patterns that have not passed deep muster

a public interface is a weighty commitment

I'm remembering a forum post from years ago, maybe even like ten years ago, where tobi acknowledged that order editing was missing and that it was important, saying (and I'm paraphrasing from memory) that it wasn't going to happen until the time was foundationally right, until they had developed _underlying_ patterns that would let them support order editing _well_.

that kind of discernment is precious

it's not the _only_ kind of discernment that is precious, but long-standing structures don't really happen without it
