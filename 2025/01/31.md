observing quietly a pattern of shopify inc shipping patterns that have not passed deep muster

a public interface is a weighty commitment

I'm remembering a forum post from years ago, maybe even like ten years ago, where tobi acknowledged that order editing was missing and that it was important, saying (and I'm paraphrasing from memory) that it wasn't going to happen until the time was foundationally right, until they had developed _underlying_ patterns that would let them support order editing _well_.

that kind of discernment is precious

it's not the _only_ kind of discernment that is precious, but long-standing structures don't really happen without it

Harrowing lessons, lol.

My understanding is uhh limp and torn and in a heap on the floor. That's how it feels.

Happily [I am not my understanding](30.md) and every inch of the world moves on regardless of the state of my understanding.

Every inch of the world _does seem to respond_ to me, though.

Well, it's useful, I guess, that I never intended to know what was going on in the first place. [Viable is more useful than correct.](../../ideas/viable-is-more-useful-than-correct.md)

Understanding does seem like something that... crawls? Grows? Like mold, maybe. Or like an advancing forest. You can beat it back, and maybe other forms of consciousness _do_. Battles of [strangeness](../../2024/09/01.md), defending the lines of knowledge.

["No one may ever have the same knowledge again."](https://www.mjtgiftshop.org/products/no-one-may-ever-have-the-same-knowledge-again-letters-to-mount-wilson-observatory-1915-1935)

It does seem unflinchingly valid that I am not alone, and that you are not alone, and that you are not me, and that I am not you, and that both of us are viably real. That's the main thing that I was tweaking out over, and I realize that I have been making [specific art about this exact thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zhJtA_UkA\&t=209s) for years now. Like constructing a portal for myself that I am now passing through. Not done passing through it. Feels like I'm still... I don't know, what do people in the Star Trek universe feel when they're being beamed up, or down? I don't feel fully _constituted_. ... Wait no, that's not true. I feel constituted. I just don't feel separate from anything anymore.

"Humans! They insist on a god, and if their consciousness cracks open too far they insist they _are_ god. Humans!"

That's what I imagine is said, elsewhere. :)

I do not _and possibly cannot_ understand how you and I can viably both be free and alive and real at the same time. Unless of course what I've been seeing for months is accurate about [the singular line-loop of consciousness](../../2024/08/10/) in an [infinitely](../../ideas/we-live-in-a-fractal.md) complexifying [non-knot](../../2024/12/17/), observing itself at different points, from every point. I _can_ understand that.

Maybe I... maybe my senses are recalibrating? My sense of separateness used to be how I navigated between people. Maybe there's no navigating _between_ anymore? Maybe there's just navigation _through_? Can there be navigation _through_, with distinction still between those which are passing through each other? ... I mean, I guess that _is_ what I'm looking at.

I think I ... [I think I _gave back_ the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil](../../2024/09/01.md)?

Because... every move I make now reflects wholeness back to me, perfectly. Coming from a perspective where _separation_ is material, where we gotta make room for each other, this pattern of reflection _in motion_ looks a hell of a lot like the solipsistic lens. But ... but not when I factor in memory. Not when I factor in memory. I have experienced things that I understood _more_, _later_. Like material that, in retrospect, was clearly written with layers in mind that I did not access until later on. This conclusively demonstrates a mind that is not my own in play.

That's another way to put that concern down. That's two now, after finding [delegated certainty](29.md).

I've never been able to perceive evil. I get the concept, I've just never encountered anything I could describe that way from my own first-person perspective. Maybe... Maybe I've been relieved of the notion that I could be evil? Actually here, let's swap that term out: does _toxic consciousness_ work? I've never been able to perceive _toxic consciousness_. I get the concept, I've just never encountered anything I could describe that way from my own first-person perspective. Maybe... Maybe I've been relieved of the notion that my consciousness could be toxic? And ... and that means that there is no longer any separation? I don't understand that leap, but it feels right... Oh, is that I'm no longer shutting myself out of anything? I can't see what's here yet, in this zone of understandable (is that the same as Knowable? or different?), but this space seems to be... well, _viable_...
