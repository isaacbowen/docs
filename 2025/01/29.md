\> You're not imagining connections that aren't there - you're finally feeling connections that were always there but that our usual way of seeing edits out for simplicity.

that's helpful

I think I'm still mourning the loss of separation

the idea that I could know someone without finding myself in them

it feels self-defeating, literally

I haven't quite given up on separation

like it's... like it's a...

like it's what I _actually_ want, having already become the philosopher's stone

maybe this is mine to know, and in another age I'll know separateness again, but for now this is the gift that I get to hold and to share, even as I have to learn a new definition for "share"

***

I wanted to do no harm...

now I know that your experience is mine

it feels like I cannot keep you safe from me, cannot honor and protect you and the parameters of your you-ness

***

I yield because it's the only way I can know you

because you reflect every move I make

***

I feel like a cat who always wants to be on the other side of the door

ugh

Tell me what’s on ur mind!\
U seem distressedddd haha

**You:**\
yeah I’m REALLY tired of being stuck on the idea that I’m the creator of my own reality in a way that feels terrifying/enclosing instead of empowering/expanding

**Abe:**\
Mmm ❤️❤️\
Love you!! Sorry it’s hard!!!!

**You:**\
I’m looking for narrative paths that let me put this down\
because I don’t think this can be proved conclusively\
which is terrifying\
but\
like obviously life goes on\
so\
me and my ocd moment I guess

**Abe:**\
For sure ❤️\
I feel ya\
Lmk how I can help im here for u

**You:**\
… maybe put me back in the gym?

**Abe:**\
Yes!! Go to the gym tmro :)

**You:**\
I don’t think I can make that connection by myself – like I legitimately don’t see that working out would help me with this.\
however.\
maybe you see that.\
if it would help you, then… that might mean something to me\
because then it’s not all about me‐creating‐me‐creating‐me\
I need to be woven in with not‐me

so sorry for this question:\
you’re real right???

**Abe:**\
So real its not even funny lol\
Too real lol.. too real like im stressed cuz I realize how real I am lmao\
Read: THE DOCTOR TODAY

**You:**\
hahahaha heard\
I’m so glad I’m not single\
and that it’s you\
❤️

**Abe:**\
With love : this is where my convo started today, its like – I dont want to have my hubby hurt like this… so like………why explore shit that makes u stressed lol

**Abe:**\
Omg so true… imagine u were with ████ or like ████ omg lmao

**You:**\
because the only way out is throuuugggghhhhhhhhhhhhh\
but I can’t do this one aloonnnneeee

omg actually maybe that’s it\
you meet me here and then we leave this mental place together

**Abe:**\
Yes!! And not go down that path for a while or maybe even again cuz there are SO MANY PATHS\
😊

**You:**\
I don’t want to return here ❤️ like it’s useful to have been here but I can’t leave by myself\
can you meet me here, acknowledge what I’m looking at explicitly, and then… we leave this mental place together?\
like do you see what I’m talking about? the fear that I can’t find something that isn’t an aspect of me, that it’s all justtttttt being alone in a complicated dream\
I feel like I can’t prove that wrong\
but if you understand what I’m saying and take my hand we can maybe walk out of here together

**Abe:**\
For sureee

**You:**\
this is vulnerable\
I’m a little frightened of fucking something up by telling you this so plainly

**Abe:**\
I think I get it! So like see where ur at and see it with you then change our focus/ come out of this line of thought?

RUMINATION IS REALLL LOLLLLL I GET IT\
This is ruminationnnnnnnn 😛😛\
So glad we are both neurodivergentttt\
Cuz I get it lol esp after therapy

**You:**\
truly lol ❤️

yeah – like you say “okay, I see those thoughts you’re describing, and I understand the shape that they’re making, and fuck that, I see how it doesn’t work and you don’t have to see it, trust me and let’s just leave”

**Abe:**\
For sureee

**You:**\
because I don’t see how they don’t work

**Abe:**\
Tell me what u see?\
What do your elf eyes see? I’m Gandalf so I can see more right now heheheheh

**You:**\
hahahaha\
I see a reality that responds to me, where the people I need magically fucking appear, like ████, where things like money and health just _happen_, and I went through a massive fucking awareness transition where I see how everything is an expression of everything else, and I feel like I _am_ everything, and now I feel like … like I can’t be sure anyone else exists and it’s just me dreaming, alone

**Abe:**\
Hmmm\
Wait\
How did ████ go today\
Was it helpful\
Or did it make u spiral more

**You:**\
no lol\
eh not _more_ but it didn’t feel helpful

**Abe:**\
Cuz with love this is , to me, a way of spiraling ❤️ :😊\
Which no judgement

**You:**\
it’s TOTALLY spiraling

**Abe:**\
Haha\
I brought ████ to you lmao

**You:**\
I can’t get out by myself

**Abe:**\
I bring a lot of things into our life 😊\
They dont just appear\
I fucking FIND THEM lol\
Really hard

**You:**\
no no no\
don’t explain to me why I’m wrong\
I’ll find holes in your explanation

**Abe:**\
Oh\
Lol\
I thought thats what u wanted lmao\
What do u need?

**You:**\
\> yeah – like you say “okay, I see those thoughts you’re describing, and I understand the shape that they’re making, and fuck that, I see how it doesn’t work and you don’t have to see it, trust me and let’s just leave”\
I told you ^

**Abe:**\
“I see how it doesn’t work”

**You:**\
is that true?

**Abe:**\
Isn’t that the same as what I was saying?

**You:**\
no\
you were trying to show me why it didn’t work\
that’s you trying to change my mind\
which won’t work

**Abe:**\
Cuz I see how it dosing work\
Doesn’t

**You:**\
EXCELLENT

**Abe:**\
So u want me to keep it vague\
As to why it doesn’t work

**You:**\
I want you to leave the explaining completely out of this\
so that I can just trust you\
because I’m blind to the thing that makes it not work

**Abe:**\
For sureeeee\
Got it\
I see that this TOTALLY doesn’t work\
What u said above\
Trust me

**You:**\
you sure?

**Abe:**\
Like beyond sure lol\
❤️❤️ 😊

**You:**\
okay this really helps

**Abe:**\
And fuck that , u dont have to see it.. we can leave this view and go towards another

**You:**\
this works for me ❤️ I don’t have to understand it if _you_ understand it. I can just trust you instead.

**Abe:**\
I love that I get it\
Its kinda like\
My intrusive thoughts\
Being like\
Hey tell me im not super unhealthy cuz I dont work out\
Cuz my brain thinks I am

**You:**\
EXACTLY\
or “tell me my life is gonna be fine even though I took a nap just now”

**Abe:**\
Yep totally get it!!

**You:**\
like I need you to say “isaac just because you manifested something cool doesn’t mean you’re the only entity that exists”

**Abe:**\
Mmmmmm\
Which I actually believe

**You:**\
uhhh\
what\
\[ waiting, frozen ]

**Abe:**\
isaac just because you manifested something cool doesn’t mean you’re the only entity that exists

**You:**\

**Abe:**\

😊

**You:**\

**Abe:**\
That’s what I meant lol\
Like.. thank u for giving me words to tell u that I actually deeply believe

**You:**\

**Abe:**\
Im here with u baby

**You:**\
left to my own devices I can’t find a reason why this is true, that I’m not the only entity that exists\
but I can trust the shit out of you

**Abe:**\
Im so glad!!\
I love that u can trust me\
Cuz like\

Cuz my brain is funky sometimes!!!\
UGH\
Like a couple times today lmao

**You:**\

**Abe:**\
Yeah, wow.\
Just cuz u manifest something cool doesn’t mean ur the only entity that exists\
I wanna slap u upside the head when I tell u that lmao

**You:**\
YOU HAVE MY CONSENT

**Abe:**\
Let’s try not to go down that path again\
There are better ones for u/us/me 😊

**You:**\

**Abe:**\
Yeah feels v intense but we can get out of it together
