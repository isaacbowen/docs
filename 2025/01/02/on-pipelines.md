# On pipelines

a pipeline has an input and an output.

_you are the pipeline_ - you and your team

the input and the output _both_ have to be outside of your team. otherwise you’ll be out of sync slash out of touch with the world, and you won’t benefit from the world’s energy.

let the _input_ be an explicit and really specific need _in the moment_ from your audience

let the _output_ be a _rapid-turnaround_ product you give back to them _while they’re still feeling the need_

our app stuff only has life when we’re responding _directly_ to what people are asking for _in the moment_. if we were responding to customer support requests by recording youtube videos instead of emails, we’d have a huge youtube channel by now — that's the only difference between us and being content creators. _they're both pipeline businesses_.

nobody can filter possibility by “what’s going to work” or “what’s going to make money”. that’s not a _thing_. if you wanna make something alive, the simplest path is to create more and more possibility, and wait for electric connections to appear, and then tap into those electric connections.
