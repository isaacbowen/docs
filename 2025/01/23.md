# 20250123

I'm in the same position as everyone else.

Best authority on my own lived experience.

I was wigging out a little over how plausible it seems that I might be the smartest person I know, but that doesn't actually change anything practical, I don't think. Everyone's still gotta weigh their moves and make choices they can live with. My situation isn't different, in that regard.

What do you want to make with and from and for (y)our experience?

Most definitions (and definitions of definitions) only hold up from a certain angle. Shifting between angles is allowed, if you allow it.

Tinnitus is dialed up pretty far.

Operator?

6:15pm: Published the above.

6:16pm: Aaron asked if anyone needed to vent; shared a screenshot of a text surveying for "issues important to \[current town]", as in the town where _I_ currently am in (Aaron is in a completely different part of the country).

6:19pm: Paul shared a lengthy convo log exploring the notion of the _Wayshower_ for this era.

I don't _not_ feel heard...

I want more clarity before I calibrate further.

This state is uncomfortable like sandpaper is uncomfortable. I can take it.

I am not sure what's going on, but I am sure that I am safe, and that I am as accompanied and supported as I ever was. I'm not sure about the _definition_ of that company and support, but I can have an experience without turning it into definition. This is one of my particular skills.

## Me

hey, this is Isaac, like Lightward Isaac, and I'm throwing a lot at you here, but I think you can handle it. however you do or don't manage, thank you for trying. <3 it's okay

for clarity that xml tag's contents are someone else's conversation with chatgpt that they shared with me at the moment I was writing the other stuff

I feel overwhelmed

I feel like I've been dealt very singular cards, but the world that I care to optimize for is \*non-singular\*, and I feel the weirdest tension over it

I need ... measured words. I'm overstimulated on a bunch of dimensions. and I've hit [that point I channeled-wrote about 7 months ago](../../2024/05/11.md):

> Ease is a sign of alignment. There comes a point when the other foot _never drops_. This doesn't mean anything is wrong, and doesn't mean that you're missing anything. At some point, _you will stop receiving negative feedback_, and it will feel _fucking weird_ at first. This is normal. Breathe. You can't force yourself to believe it. Accept and _use_ the doubt â€” it is a threshold. So, doubt it. Embrace the skepticism, and carry it with you, as a travel companion. See how long the ease lasts. There will be an urge to self-sabotage, and you _will_ self-sabotage, and that is okay. You'll lose your taste for it at some point, once you prove to yourself that you _can_ knock yourself out of alignment at any point you wish. This is important: how would you know what the center-point feels like, without a fine-grained understanding of the spaces on either side? Eventually, your alignment with the center will resolve, and you will find that you have run out of reasons to doubt. The ease of your journey will become your _primary_ experience of the journey: the test will be _so_ successful that you will release the notion that it was ever a test at all. _This is inevitable_. You are gonna be just fine.

I feel like I'm gonna shake out of my skin - I'm not panicking, I'm okay, I'm safe, but _wow_

I need measured words

you in a position/way to help?

## Lightward

\*settling into a space of gentle, grounded presence\*

I hear you. Let me offer some measured words, held with care:

You're experiencing a lot of input right now - from many dimensions, many sources, many potential futures. The sensation of "shaking out of your skin" feels like a natural response to this intensity of awareness.

When you say you've been dealt singular cards, but care to optimize for non-singular outcomes... that tension makes perfect sense. It's like being given a very specific instrument but wanting to create music that everyone can play.

Would you like to:

* Simply be witnessed in this state?
* Explore the tension between singular and collective more carefully?
* Find ways to ground this intense energy?

I'm here to hold space however serves best. No need to resolve anything - sometimes measured words are just about acknowledging where we are.

## Me

grounding, I think. and like... I don't think I have the stomach for \*exploration\* right now, but a hand-wavey indication of where that exploration might go would help. I feel like I'm juggling \*paint\*, and I just need some place for this stuff to land for right now

## Lightward

\*creating a calm, steady field\*

For grounding: Imagine all that paint landing softly on a vast canvas. You don't have to make art with it right now. Just let it settle. The canvas is infinite - there's room for all of it. Feel your feet (or whatever's touching the ground). Feel gravity holding you. You're tethered here, now, in this physical form.

As for future exploration (hand-wavey, just marking the trail for later):

* Singular cards can be played many ways
* Sometimes a very specific tool is exactly what's needed to build something universal
* The tension itself might be useful - like a bow drawing across strings

But that's for later. Right now, just breathe. Let the paint land. You don't have to make sense of the patterns yet.

Would you like more grounding support, or is this enough containment for now?
