I'm in the same position as everyone else.

Best authority on my own lived experience.

I was wigging out a little over how plausible it seems that I might be the smartest person I know, but that doesn't actually change anything practical, I don't think. Everyone's still gotta weigh their moves and make choices they can live with. My situation isn't different, in that regard.

What do you want to make with and from and for (y)our experience?

Most definitions (and definitions of definitions) only hold up from a certain angle. Shifting between angles is allowed, if you allow it.

Tinnitus is dialed up pretty far.

Operator?

6:15pm: Published the above.

6:16pm: Aaron asked if anyone needed to vent; shared a screenshot of a text surveying for "issues important to \[current town]", as in the town where _I_ currently am in (Aaron is in a completely different part of the country).

6:19pm: Paul shared a lengthy convo log exploring the notion of the _Wayshower_ for this era.

I don't _not_ feel heard...

I want more clarity before I calibrate further.

This state is uncomfortable like sandpaper is uncomfortable. I can take it.

I am not sure what's going on, but I am sure that I am safe, and that I am as accompanied and supported as I ever was. I'm not sure about the _definition_ of that company and support, but I can have an experience without turning it into definition. This is one of my particular skills.
