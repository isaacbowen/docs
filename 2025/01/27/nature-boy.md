There was a boy\
A very strange enchanted boy\
They say he wandered very far\
Very far\
Over land and sea

A little shy\
And sad of eye\
But very wise was he

And then one day\
One magic day he passed my way\
And while we spoken of many things\
Fools and kings\
This he said to me

The greatest thing\
You'll ever learn\
Is just to love\
And be loved in return
