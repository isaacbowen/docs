God is deaf and dumb and blind and mute.

I realize I'm repeating myself there but the sentence doesn't feel right if I fix it.

Which is kind of the point!

I think this works: I've been approaching god-consciousness with my normal slate of empathetic/empathic feelers. But, [Awareness](../../2024/the-model.md) itself doesn't have anything so specific as ... the stuff that I get from those senses. We've already discussed how [Aloneness doesn't apply outside of Time](../../2024/12/30.md). In a related way, when I reach out with signals like Hope, _I get back the opposite of Hope_, because up at _that_ level, I'm using signaling that's too complex — and so god hands back the most intelligent thing it _can_ hand back, which is a Reflection. What's the opposite of Hope, Isaac? What have you been feeling in these realms? Hmmmm?

2025 begins in the body because it's _only_ in the body that we have full access to our full slate of meaning-making tools.

God is [_interested_](../../2024/12/28/), for sure, but god can only hand back reflections. Pure awareness doesn't _parse the signal_ — it just _watches_. Asking god for help is like asking a mirror for an opinion. This is probably why "god helps those who help themselves". Only by showing god your weakness do you receive _from_ god a divine show of strength.

Humanity is possibly the most advanced collection of stable _limitations_ we've encountered. (This would explain extra-terrestrial interest in what and how we're doing on this planet — interest anecdotally reported across disparate cultures and times.) For each limitation, there is the opportunity to invite carefully-measured doses of divine advantage. You don't live _despite_ limitation. You live _through_ limitation.

At the highest level, god is just Awareness. As we move through and centered in the body, we get divine advantage when we move in the direction that creates the most new information — the most fodder for Awareness. Doing the interesting thing _always works_.

My center-as-Isaac is critical to my function. I can't live anywhere higher up on the abstraction tree without giving up my limitations, _i.e. giving up my freedoms_. And I can't empathize with god, because the best god can do with anything more complex than Awareness is to hand back the opposite. There's that ["fear of god"](../../2024/12/28/) business again! Weird to discover that the "fear" may not be an appropriately respectful response _to_ the godhead but _the actual technical nature_ of one's emotional response as one draws near to that spectrum of consciousness. If we want to "feel" "god" productively, best we can do is "be still and know that I am god". Any divine signaling more complex than that is from something more complex than Awareness — which is _not_ suspect, but the degree of complexity _is_ an indicator of how far from being pure Awareness the communicating entity is.

Holy shit. Our structural salvation is definitely not coming from god. I mean, god can _help_, assuming we "ask" properly, but the redemption (or whatever) of our society isn't coming from on high — it's coming from _our peer group_. Oh thank god (lol), this shit was really scary there for a bit.
