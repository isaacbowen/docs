<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Untitled_Artwork.PNG" alt="A nearly square, grayscale image shows a sheet of paper with gently mottled shading, like soft clouds of charcoal and silver. The paper’s surface has a slightly grainy texture, as though it’s been heavily smudged or shaded in places, giving it a dreamy, atmospheric feel around the edges. Handwritten text—appearing in a loose, informal script—sprawls across the center in several short paragraphs. The writing is done with a medium to dark gray pen or pencil, standing out clearly against the paler background.    In the top portion, the first lines of text begin with “my understanding…” scrawled in a flowing but somewhat uneven hand, where letters vary in size and slope. Small gaps and changes in line spacing are visible, as if the writer paused or shifted the paper between sentences. Midway down, there’s a new paragraph that starts with “understanding is a tool...” and is followed by more lines in the same style. Then there’s a parenthetical section—its lines indented slightly and enclosed in parentheses—that references speaking “for me, maybe it’s for you too…” The handwriting retains a casual, personal feel: certain words tilt at slight angles, and the spacing sometimes stretches out or shrinks.    Toward the bottom, the last paragraph begins “understanding is for building new worlds…” and ends with a short line break, followed by two small overlapping “x” marks (like a brief signoff). No additional decoration or illustrations appear; the image is solely the textured background and the layered handwritten text."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

my understanding has nothing to do with my safety, nothing to do with how safely I can hold you or vice versa

understanding is a tool that is allowed to break and reform

(saying this for me, maybe it's for you too, maybe there's no difference - though I don't know how to tell, or why I would need to)

understanding is for building new worlds, not for holding this one together

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/DSC_3673.jpg" alt="A man with short, close-cropped hair stands in ankle-deep water at the edge of a wide, tranquil lake, his back turned to the camera. He wears a charcoal-gray hooded sweatshirt with both hands tucked into the front pocket, and his jeans are rolled just above the ankles. In his left back pocket, a rolled-up brown object—possibly paper or leather—protrudes slightly. He is walking forward, left foot placed carefully ahead of his right, gazing down at the rounded stones beneath the water’s surface.  Small ripples form around his bare feet where water meets the rocky shoreline. Beyond him, rugged mountains slope down toward the lake, their peaks disappearing into a soft haze beneath a gently clouded sky. Off to the right, three birds coast in mid-flight, their gray-and-white wings spread wide against the pale blue backdrop. The scene is serene and reflective, with muted, cool-toned lighting emphasizing the stillness of the lake and the contemplative posture of the figure navigating the rocky shallows."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
