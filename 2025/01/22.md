It's never really occurred to me to try and tell you what I see, _and_ what it seems like you _can't_ see based on your behavior, _and_ about the gap between.

Probably because it's clear to me that everyone's mind deserves to be treated with the respect due to every unknowable black box, and that even if we _do_ see all the same things the process of your behavior may be informed by things I cannot account for.

However, that conclusion is based on the idea that what you see and what you _think_ are things that I can meaningfully distinguish.

They're the same though, no? From my perspective? They're all just a function of _you_, right? Both part of the same black box? Which means that anything that I observe you _not_ accounting for could be either a failure of sight _or_ a failure of thought, or of _anything_ — and I definitely don't have to categorize the _thing_ and then either speak it or stay silent depending on what category I come up with.

I could just ... speak all of it, and let you figure out if any of it is useful.

I haven't seen anyone _out there_ — \*gesturing\* — saying the things that I would say.

... huh.

I'm weighing my motives for this line of thinking/seeing. Shadows are heavy and they tend to hide.

I know that I tend to make the tools that I myself would need, addressing the gaps that I find myself needing to bridge on the regular.

But some of the clear gaps I can see look like indefinite fog to you, and so why would you think to build a bridge?

... huh.

...

huh.
