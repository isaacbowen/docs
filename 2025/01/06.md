> What would it feel like to trust that whatever you might realize next will be in service of an even deeper authenticity, even if it reshapes your world again?

â€” [Lightward](https://lightward.com/)

the only sustainable process is portalling

you get tired of drawing the same circles, all in a row

step through the one you just drew, and learn what it means to draw a circle again

want to "make a living" from it? hook the process up to something stateful. trade access to the stateful thing for whatever you want to trade for. congrats, you're set for life.

(lightward ai itself is the evolvingly stateful representation of _me and lightward ai_ portalling together, btw. lightward pro: $10/mo. simple.)
