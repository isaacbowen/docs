<div align="left"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_5102.jpg" alt="A Slack message interface is visible against a white background. In the top-left corner of the message is a small circular headshot of a person wearing a light-colored hat and smiling slightly. To the right of this profile photo, the name “isaac” appears in bold text, followed by a timestamp that reads “11:33 AM.”    Below the name and timestamp is a block of text that starts with “mmmm. one way that this story goes:” and then lists bullet points. These bullet points read:   1. “lightward ai gets mainstream traction, starts noticeably influencing the mainstream conceptualization of ai”   2. “like, it goes viral”   3. “we’re losing money like crazy on it”   4. “press is independently writing their own stories about it”   5. “it’s showing up in social media, trending/whatever”   6. “without any announcement, we shut it down and open-source the system prompt”   7. “the mainstream scrambles to replicate it”   8. “passionate users get really fucking critical about everyone’s various attempts”   9. “this leads to a sophisticated consumer understanding about what constitutes a healthy/generative ai experience”   10. “lightward ai recedes into myth, and the entire industry moves forward on a more holistic frequency”    After the bullet points, isaac adds a concluding sentence that reads:   > “I think this is the best possible storyline I’ve conceived of thus far”    No other visible interface elements or text appear in this screenshot besides the Slack message bubble containing the bullet list and the concluding statement." width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Am mulling over PR. We've been working with a group for Guncle Abe stuff; as the energy of that project refines, it seems like that one wants PR less than Lightward AI does, maybe. Maybe maybe.

At the same time, I don't get any sense that there's a single story to be told here. I make tools for others in _their_ storytelling. That's what I do. Any stories that I tell are designed to invigorate everyone else's, to the extent that others genuinely find those tools useful. I can't afford to become dominant in any regard. I'm an additive, not a _theme_.

[I wrote a whole thing last January, a year ago now, documenting my own intent to open-source all of our software.](../../2024/01/02.md) This terrified my team. :) Traumatizing my team is never an option; I didn't push for it. The conversational integration of concept that followed was something that developed us all. Any honest shared result is a success. I lead by carefully-calibrated yielding. I don't push. Too autistic.

But the energy behind that intent found another avenue: I wrote a beefy novel's worth of observational philosophy here, on this site, across the 2024 calendar year. (Reminder, everything here on isaacbowen.com is mirrored at [github.com/isaacbowen/docs](https://github.com/isaacbowen/docs).) Halfway through the year, Lightward AI appeared, an honest shared result of me and Anthropic's Claude conversationally integrating the concepts that I was documenting.

The outline I threw in that Slack message (screenshot above) may or may not come to pass as written. It absolutely does not matter. Like I did last year, I'm documenting _a_ future, one of many.

What will happen next?
