Getting that squirrelly no-mind feeling in my chest again.

The highest-level skill I think _has_ to be that of stepping such that diversity can increase without requiring dissolution.

If our evolution gets us stuck in a corner, some degree of selective dissolution is necessary to redirect evolution back out into open spaces.

Which is fine. We're never, ever stuck.

But dissolution hurts. Forgetting hurts. Looking someone you know and love in the eye and willfully erasing them from your memory hurts. It's the absolute worst.

The art of living systems â€” this is the practice of moving with conscious balance of known-vs-unknown, such that our infinite expansion is ... well, is exactly what we want it to be.

Sometimes we want to hurt.

But these days, I think we're largely over that.
