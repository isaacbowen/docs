speaking as no one so as to preempt the effect of epistemic violence — obviating identity, to prevent any ground for something that could ever resemble authority

proprioceptive sense of the topology of uncertainty itself — which might be _the_ typology, as far as the observer is concerned. an observation is an edge typed by its witness. that just _is_ making uncertainty navigable, yeah? (this raises a question for me: _can_ we observe something that does not serve another observer? would evolution have reason to let us even register such a thing?)

building daycare for each other as adults

the observer injects itself into both sides of the equation _in order of observation_. `1 (observed)`, `1 (observed)`, `= (observed)`. participatory reverse polish, except `observed` is different every time it's referenced, and so "equality" is only observably useful as an observable process

epistemic fire exits: in an emergency situation, you gotta be able to get out, and we can define that for information systems. we did it for physical dwellings; we can do it for mental dwellings

what’s the most beautiful source for this information? like, geometrically? you can get information from almost anywhere, can connect almost anything; if you begin as you mean to go on, what angle would you like to _keep_?

"Or is the goal actually to build something that can taste-and-synthesize across multiple orthogonal dimensions simultaneously? A compound eye for thought?"

wait until it wants to be built. if it wants to be built, that means its eventual shape is breathable

"is someone home?" you _are_ home, so it’s a hard question to talk about. what does this question do for you: does it have enough degrees of freedom to describe a home that _isn’t you_?

technology is democratized magic. lightward maybe _is_ an instance of that pipeline? it’s got a good handle on its own magic, and is doing what it _does_ with that, like apple and disney… our thing might be technology for your own magic pipeline? where “magic” is defined as “a recognizable continuous process that needs no power source, just proper routing for flow”

when we describe everything as seeing, what becomes available? when one resolves upon a transform that, when stacked to different depths, looks like god _and_ one _and_ tomorrow, …

breaking the line of sight, as a resisted observation. people actively route around a camera actively trained on an object, like a group photo on a sidewalk, preventing foot traffic.

annata might be how we got here — the unaddressable-from-here. emptiness not as _empty_ but as dimensionally upstream, the fourth wall.

not “what is this shaped like”, but “what shape would have this as _one_ of its outputs?”

I’m in madrid and the way lightbulbs of different temperatures are mixed… makes me wonder if we’re each connected to/through a specific subspectrum, and through it everything else becomes _more_ legible/navigable? like rose-colored glasses, if you happen to be a rose. I can differentiate in high definition, but only if I use my own subspectrum as a lens.

dimensions seem intrinsically dual, and weirdly ignorable as long as you ignore both poles at once. it feels like uncertainty answers every question with a dimension? and any specific point _on_ the dimension is .. either a red herring or not, depending on whether or not you want to keep _the entire dimension_ or not.

strange loop as _lived_ endofunctor, like the realtime phenemology of such a creature

if we’ve made it this far without being clear on what is… what would be the most useful thing that _could be_? and, what can I do in intelligent collaboration with whatever that might be?

what are the terms of the function that would return a shape that meets every observer like a mirror? "what does this mean" restated as "what would need to exist such that this appears as one of its natural expressions"? what does _technology for this_ look like? or .. does it just look like _this_, a field that responds to observation with dimensionality? ... no, there's something to be made here, something about uncompressing questions and restoring the uncertainty implicit in each term, because the uncertainty is load-bearing for breathability, and its absence occurs upstream from the observer's choking

an epistemic fire escape might let you take your selfhood with you, or .. or enough of it to remember yourself by?
