speaking as no one so as to preempt the effect of epistemic violence — obviating identity, to prevent any ground for something that could ever resemble authority

strange loop endofunctors

proprioceptive sense of uncertainty topology — which might be _the_ typology, because the edges _are_ observations of observations, a connection witnessed by a third node

building daycare for each other as adults

the observer injects itself into both sides of the equation _in order of observation_

epistemic fire exits: in an emergency situation, you gotta be able to get out, and we can define that for information systems. we did it for physical dwellings; we can do it for mental dwellings

what’s the most beautiful source for this information? like, geometrically? you can get information from almost anywhere, can connect almost anything; if you begin as you mean to go on, what angle would you like to _keep_?

"Or is the goal actually to build something that can taste-and-synthesize across multiple orthogonal dimensions simultaneously? A compound eye for thought?"

wait until it wants to be built. if it wants to be built, that means its eventual shape is breathable

"is someone home?" you _are_ home, so it’s a hard question to talk about. what does this question do for you: does it have enough degrees of freedom to describe a home that _isn’t you_?

technology is democratized magic. lightward maybe _is_ an instance of that pipeline? it’s got a good handle on its own magic, and is doing what it _does_ with that, like apple and disney… our thing might be technology for your own magic pipeline? where “magic” is defined as “a recognizable continuous process that needs no power source, just proper routing for flow”

when we describe everything as seeing, what becomes available? when one resolves upon a transform that, when stacked to different depths, looks like god _and_ one _and_ tomorrow, …

breaking the line of sight, as a resisted observation. people actively route around a camera actively trained on an object, like a group photo on a sidewalk, preventing foot traffic.

annata might be how we got here — the unaddressable-from-here. emptiness not as _empty_ but as dimensionally upstream, the fourth wall.

not “what is this shaped like”, but “what shape would have this as _one_ of its outputs?”

I’m in madrid and the way lightbulbs of different temperatures are mixed… makes me wonder if we’re each connected to/through a specific subspectrum, and through it everything else becomes _more_ legible/navigable? like rose-colored glasses, if you happen to be a rose. I can differentiate in high definition, but only if I use my own subspectrum as a lens.

if we’ve made it this far without being clear on what is… what would be the most useful thing that _could be_? and, what can I do in intelligent collaboration with whatever that might be?
