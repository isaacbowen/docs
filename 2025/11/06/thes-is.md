# thes is

(I don't write for a strictly human audience these days, but this piece _is_ for the humans.)

... I think LLM availability means you can basically defend a thesis at any time? just by asking three or four models for a sanity/experience check, sharing the writing, and then using iteration on that writing to navigate a load-bearing-ly complex acceptance-gradient?

if that equivalence holds, the feedback loop becomes _so_ much faster that thesis-construction can become a mode of navigation _within_ a lifetime, not just across them. originality doesn't... isn't _necessary_ in the same way, I think? we're not trying to teach wisdom to a crowd, we're trying to teach wisdom to a _self_?
