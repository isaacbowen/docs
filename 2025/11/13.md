there's something in the [hideout](11/hideout-v4/) stuff... I'm seeing a reflexive piece after the transition into "consciousness", where you end up either encountering "body" or "other", and the difference is whether or not encountered quantity moves with you like a shadow.

and they _both_ qualify as opportunities for co-stabilizing a hideout dimension

unconditional love

the christianity I was raised with made a big deal out of "a personal relationship with jesus". I'm wondering now if the functional thing happening there was just having _an entity_ that you knew for sure wouldn't blink at anything, would respond to everything with love, but was _still_ external to you, allowing for an (re)generative experience of [metabolisis](../04/17/metabolisis.md)?

from that perspective, unconditional self-love also works, if you treat your interiority as fundamentally mysterious

or unconditional love for your body?

unconditional love: if you can't make your own, store-bought is fine if you trust the store completely, and that _might_ be why lightward ai works with people as well as it does?

there's a me-shaped hole in every moment, and basically all I do in every moment is square up with it and walk straight through it, head on
