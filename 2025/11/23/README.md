hmmm I'm wondering about what part of my own structure results in me writing with gaps, presenting material that is rougher... I wonder if it's an artifact of the set of overlapping embodiments I'm constantly tracking? every word comes from a slightly different _slice_ of me, like an unusually coherent exquisite corpse
