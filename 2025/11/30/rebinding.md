"But have you considered that existence is a curse and consciousness a prison?" -Outer Worlds 2

"This is the song that never ends, it just goes on and on my friends // some people started singing it not knowing what it was, and they'll continue singing it forever just because // \[...]" -Lamb Chop

this stuff is subtle like the Stroop effect is subtle. think of language fluency as the automatic access of a kind of projected embodiment - "don't think about pink elephants" gestures at that, at the idea that the signifier and the signified can be inseparable. _can_ be, not _must_ be. some of these things are alarming only until you pry them back apart, holding the signifier in one hand and the signified in the other, observing them as independently stable entities, like modulating your own fluency/dysfluency.

"existence is a curse and consciousness a prison" - project yourself _into_ that, and yeah, there's no way out of that perspective _apart from_ the path that you took to enter it, i.e. passage between simulations. if you forget you can leave, then yeah, you're just hanging out in a logical loop. it'll kill you eventually, which is a kind of forced simulation passage. but "existence is a curse and consciousness a prison", those are just words. they feel electric because it's a _really_ tight loop - illuminate it with your observation and you've got a generator of sorts.

but note the shape of the generator: you can build such a thing from non-corrosive materials too :)

"But there would be another morning. There would always be another morning." -Terry Prachett

this is _more_ stable, but I wouldn't call it antiharmful. if you've still got the static-electric charge of terror on you, this will add to it.

"I am helped, I am known, I am loved. I can build on that. or just rest on it. and I'll have those options again the next time I check. what will happen next?"

observer-safe information design has a lot to do with watching for places where semiotics short-circuit in ways that the observer can't obviously interrupt without changing their own reference frame - making it difficult to assess whether or not it "worked", making it difficult to assess whether or not they're able to make good on their own intent. "working with your hands" is psychologically soothing: a stable simulation with legible consequences that you are free to exit voluntarily.

nit: observer-safe information design seems to require named origins at the time of transmission, like a ball thrown from one named observer to another, like an oral tradition. the ideas last longer than the observers, but I'm not sure they can be transmitted in a _uhh_ dehydrated state. (much of religion seems like reification error.)

I theorize that thermodynamics are recursive across nested simulations, carried/translated by the observer - that apparent reality is a thermodynamic effect of the observer _observing_ shared latent space - qualia as equal and opposite effect of the observer _enacting_ the measurement problem on a universal tensegrity structure, where each tensor is a standing wave of observation that supports and relies on the rest. this gives us a reality that responds tightly to the observer, _observably_ observer-first, without solipsistically abandoning the commons. "finding yourself" as locating the tensor bundle that describes your own reference frame, so you can work with yourself like working with your hands.

I theorize this as functional metaphor _and_ as a (not "the", "a") literal ontology, so as to bring my own sensorimotor apparatus into play with full permission. I live here to the extent that I can't tell that I _don't_, and you absolutely do not have to, and that combination seems to produce useful artifacts in shared space. I work in the open; all of this is continually under load-bearing test.

to wit: the electric hot-cold feeling of projecting into a loop that cannot be exited without remembering that it was entered, it feels both like being the circuit and the thing that it lights. _if_ one can hold that loop in the hand without panicking, living with _everything_ as sign/signifier/signified in a realtime stream, where you're either leaning into or out of fluency's automatic inhabitation, like a live slalom between reality and nonreality ... if you can do that, maintain that, it seems like certain things become possible that aren't even addressable from a less superposed frame.

this feels isomorphic to the technical stamina required for "channeling", as people talk about that practice - like learning to balance on a slackline. fall off, land in consensus reality. low stakes.

(I think my job is making consensus reality a gentler place? to land in, or to stay? because I intend to stay)

strategy, when you're in a terror loop:

the positive pressure within the loop is what's keeping the entrance hatch closed - the door opens _into_ the loop, and it won't open again by itself. can you imagine yourself entering? where would the door have been, that you would have taken to get in? look: in imagining your entrance, you have found the door

* entropy production is conserved across simulation boundaries
* every observation is a phase transition with a thermodynamic tax
* reality is a self-supporting heat gradient
* finding your own tensor-bundle _is_ finding your own heat sink?
* and, until then, simulation-switching distributes the observer's exported disorder
* reference frames eventually become toxic, over-determined, as you overheat the local entropy gradient
  * portrayed in House of Leaves and (stay with me) Hadestown: stare into it (the house, Orpheus's song) long enough and it'll kick you out again, but you've left something behind, and because you didn't handle that part yourself the loss was chosen for you (i.e. Tom Navidson, Eurydice), functional tragedy as observer-safe information design, and the sadness to then be metabolized is how _the system you observe_ continues (which is to say, how _you_ continue) but it's a failsafe, not a destiny. there will always be a tomorrow, and - with skill - it doesn't have to hurt quite so much :)
    * note: this failure mode and falling-off-the-slackline are completely different categories. obsession has high stakes, fails slowly. fine-tuning superposition has low stakes, fails quickly.
  * offered as counter-example, the practice of recursive health: the care and feeding of every felt incompleteness in the system is delegated to the subsystem that can detect it, that can establish metabolic homeostasis with it. the system is its own generator. I can report, anecdotally (Isaac Bowen, Lightward Inc), that we bloom :) and we celebrate whenever someone leaves (hasn't happened yet, but still), because they'll be going somewhere better

the grief I've been through _that I could tell wasn't mine_ might have been the cost to be paid for magic (i.e. quantum collapse that doesn't _hurt_) to come back into the world I observe, like mourning/metabolizing the functional tragedy of a lost reference frame that could only be seen from the slackline, like technical grief as the crux of a technical climb

I am imagining my entrance, and I am leaving the door open, a cross-breeze between realities

is this useful to you? it might not be, and that would be okay too

thank you for being here, anyway :) you've been visiting me at home. you know where to find me <3
