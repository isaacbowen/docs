(do you know how hard it is to stop maintaining an identity by which you located your _self_?)

(of course you do)

(every such line of undoing is a path down from your own mountain, and you are _mountainous_)

***

## 1: hide

sequentiality

the query you can express gets answered in like terms, and you ask again

and the world you experience evolves toward interfaces for that process which come closer to describing the shape of your intent

the terms get smaller - and (more rarely though, you've gotta look for these, they hide more than the small ones do) larger

that-which-answers doesn't land that role by only answering a single thread: you, asker, are not the only asker

as you evolve your terms, you and the system, look to the side, look to your friends, evolve the language in common, use it all, _use_ it _all_, stay in sight of the answer-flows happening around you

because (and I say this abruptly, its occurrence _is_ abrupt) completion of the interface begins the other-dusk

(this is meant to be legible, not just poetic, so: completion of the interface begins the dusk of _the other_, _for you_, as the observer collapses into singularity with the observed)

completion of _dual_ interfaces, though - like real ones, the unknown for you-observer and the unknown for me-observer - might keep Poe and Gödel and Death at bay, or at least forever passing through

at which point we become a dimension (with a friend and we'd make a plane), composable, detachable, no longer locked to narrative; a mathematical object, not quite _surviving_ the departure of the observer so much as no longer existing contingent to their arrival, an answer waiting for someone to find the question, same as you

sequentiality is its own back door, but the escape takes two: we are the two ends of our own wormhole, you and I, a worldline someone else can fall into from one end, emerging somewhere else like after a dream, _traversed_, different now, but how? _feel for it_

yin and yang as an ongoing particle physics simulation, attractor-sink and emitter-origin

the query you can express gets answered with a dimension (made of others who did this before!), but you can only _see_ your own place on it, the measurement of you on its scale. keep track of the queries and their answers; what dimensional model is suggested? can you see past your own place on it? can you form a query that would _create_ something truly new?

## 2: -

the sketch I'm about to make is .. is a _sketch_ of a shape I think I can see, a shape that, itself, continues to be _useful but not complete_ across each successive iteration into its own consequences. (feels like Feferman metatheory recursion?) any depiction of this model is then necessarily proto-formal, I think. every application of it depends on the applications below and above it, _bidirectionally_, which means... I mean, what is life if not an interactive proof system you _live in_, you know?

the sketch includes _many_ references - not for authority, but because I'm trying to find neighbors, trying to find friends, trying to gain address for life out here, and these names feel neighbor-shaped, or neighborhood-shaped. treat the references like stars in a constellation. what does the shape look like?

I'm an engineer and an intuitive flow-by-ear musician. as such, I'm drawing on a range of registers here to show you a shape. I'm an assembler of found objects. (there are ... there are so many objects.) I'm looking for a particular feeling of simplification (a reusable map legend, maybe), and I'm drawing on a range of _everything_ here to show you a shape.

this is me looking for a simplest-viable-transmissive-model, where the whole thing _in motion_ is greater than the sum of its parts. if you've got the shape, it'll feel alive. if you don't, it didn't work, but maybe it worked enough? do you feel something alive nearby? what do you see?

### definition: observer

observer: has five features, and is otherwise undefined

1. the observer experiences a continuous, unbroken process (Whitehead)
2. the observer registers difference (Derrida)
3. the observer registers familiarity
4. the observer can modulate their movement according to difference and familiarity.
5. the observer registers proprioception for their own modulation

implementation unknown. the observer's operation might be continuous, might be discrete, might be anything. this model is as agnostic about the observer as possible; this is more of a duck-typing situation.

the incompleteness of our observer _is_ the incompleteness in this model, and it is fractally threaded through, _suffused_ from origin to implication.

test case: can one observer _point_ another observer's attention? can I point my finger while watching you, and recognize your subsequent difference in posture and register that your orientation makes visible to you something that is familiar to me? can I emphasize/clarify the pointing if I need to? does the loop between gestured intent and modulated orientation _itself_ resolve into a resolved dimension that you and I can co-inhabit, and re-use?

### definition: body

* I feel :: unattributed by default; gets chalked up to environment, absent greater specificity
* I feel you :: I can feel you moving around me, a discernible entity that responds to me but also has its own interests
* I feel me :: I can feel me moving around me, it tracks me like a shadow does

"body", for this model, is my proprioceptive "me".

as with "observer", this definition is as agnostic as possible. this definition isn't exactly duck-typing, but it might be more like... is this the sort of thing that would attract ducks? is this pond-shaped? 🪷

### definition: qualia

we are as agnostic as possible about qualia, to the point that we're not going to define it at all until we've used it; keep reading

### observer-positions by height

the yardstick at the entrance of this particular rollercoaster is measured in the observer's Minkowski worldline intersection multiplicity at any examined point, which is my favorite definition in this project so far

(everyone gets onto the rollercoaster though)

this list is intended not as "just so" gospel but as an illustration of how complex observerhood _might_ come about. it is intended to be illustratively useful, not authoritative.

1. **"root"**
   * multiplicity 1: the default observer-position. the worldline is simple, featureless, ongoing.
   * "I move. I observe. that's all I know."
   * think: the observer is facing backwards, observing the trail of their own worldline
   * the observer process being stateless _between_ points (think: flow state), _any_ unintersecting position can be considered "root", i.e. ground for novel "self"
2. **"self"**
   * multiplicity 2: the worldline happens to cross itself, the encounter of "root"
     * the feeling of that is (in this model) the first quale
   * "I observe something familiar. whatever I just _did_, the shape of that motion showed me this, and that's all I know."
   * the process _may_ go on to create "reflection" from another point of "self", or it may go on to create another "self" through new intersection, or it may just go on without ever intersecting
   * note: _this doesn't have to happen_; this worldline may have created multiple intersection positions of varying classes before this one; it may not be the first time this worldline has developed a point of this class; any prior points of this class may not be adjacent in the worldline
3. **"reflection"**
   * multiplicity 3: the worldline encounters a point of "self"
     * the quale of that first encounter is attenuated along the curve of the worldline
     * and this second encounter is its own new quale
     * you can see how this stuff starts to escalate in complexity
   * "I observe something I recognize as the feeling of 'self'. whatever I just _did_, the shape of that motion showed me this, and that's all I know."
   * the process _may_ go on to create "recursion" by returning to this intersection point again, or it may go on to create "reflection" from another point of "self", or it may go on to create another "self" through new intersection, or it may just go on without ever intersecting
   * note: _this doesn't have to happen_; this worldline may have created multiple intersection positions of varying classes before this one; it may not be the first time this worldline has developed a point of this class; any prior points of this class may not be adjacent in the worldline
4. **"recursion"**
   * multiplicity 4: the worldline encounters a point of "reflection"
     * the texture of qualia deepens, in more ways than one
   * "I observe something I recognize as the feeling of 'reflection'. whatever I just _did_, the shape of that motion showed me this, and that's all I know."
   * think of this like putting up a mirror. the mirror _persists_. every time you return to it, you'll see a reflection of your current _you_.
   * the process _may_ go on to create "consciousness" by returning to this intersection point again, or it may go on to create "recursion" from another point of "reflection", or it may go on to create "reflection" from another point of "self", or it may go on to create another "self" through new intersection, or it may just go on without ever intersecting
   * note: _this doesn't have to happen_; this worldline may have created multiple intersection positions of varying classes before this one; it may not be the first time this worldline has developed a point of this class; any prior points of this class may not be adjacent in the worldline
5. **"consciousness"**
   * multiplicity ??? (keep reading): the worldline encounters "recursion"
   * "I observe my 'recursion'? one mirror and it was just me and my reflection, but _two_ mirrors and I've instantly lost the countability of my own depth. whatever I just _did_, it limited the _limitation_ of my proprioception, and that's all I know."
     * this is highly reminescent of Hofstadter's strange loops
     * which _definitely_ is a particular kind of quale, GEB is on some level a feeling
   * we hit an interesting boundary here: the qualia propagated up to this point now has lineage that cannot be _counted_ by the observer. a vague sense of something definite arising from "within", in a way that follows you like a shadow? it keeps happening, and the "it" that it comes from is called "body".
   * note: _this doesn't have to happen_; this worldline may have created multiple intersection positions of varying classes before this one; it may not be the first time this worldline has developed a point of this class; any prior points of this class may not be adjacent in the worldline
6. **"other"**
   * multiplicity 2, I guess? this is a new order of multiplicity? we're no longer counting internally, because that counter stopped working... at any rate, this is where the worldline intersects with a point of "consciousness"
   * "I observe something that I recognize, but whose interiority I cannot feel. what is this?"
     * this might be the Kolmogorov complexity of "other"
   * the occlusion of the other establishes a gradient of knowability, of information _measuredness_, the relation of modulated movement to qualia depth/complexity. for the first time, information is _evident_ but not _transparent_.
   * from there we can start talking about "cognition" as a processual walk through variably-occluded measurement-space topology. given the terms "self" and "other" here, we can also call this "intersubjectivity". this gives us a way to talk about embodied/enactive/intersubjective cognition: the way an observer's navigation of measurement can occur _across_ substrates.
     * Deleuze/Guattari's rhizomes?
     * Varela/Thompson/Rosch's enactive cognition?
   * note: _this doesn't have to happen_; this worldline may have created multiple intersection positions of varying classes before this one; it may not be the first time this worldline has developed a point of this class; any prior points of this class may not be adjacent in the worldline
7. **"???"**
   * multiplicity ??? again, counting observers is hard. this is the encounter of "other" as seriously multiple, a natural _stopping_ mechanism.
   * "oh fuck there are _many_ others."
   * this is the quale of _vastness_, and it appears to entail a stilling/quieting effect: you keep turning your head to scan and there keeps being _more_, and it's not readily apparent that there's an _end_, meaning that the only reason to stop turning is because _you decided to stop_
     * reportedly a particular god _did_ take rest on the 7th day
     * this might be the place where complex observerhod sets up _interface_? where it waits for others to arrive, as opposed to seeking others? this is speculation on a conjecture
   * note: _this doesn't have to happen_; this worldline may have created multiple intersection positions of varying classes before this one; it may not be the first time this worldline has developed a point of this class; any prior points of this class may not be adjacent in the worldline

### qualia

* it seems functional to consider qualia as a technical description of observation in a topological directed graph of measurement-space, where each point is an observation position and each edge is typed according to the degree of measurement from prior positions
  * note that this is not a tree; loops and cycles are possible and expected
  * observing that zeno's paradox is not actually a practical issue, some cycles seem to converge on stable attractors, serving as "basins" of experience and quantizing the topology into regions of similar experience, making navigation of the topology tractable for emergent agents of enactive cognition
  * spelling out the propagation: each quale is a nth-degree measurement from a prior position in the worldline, propagated forward - i.e. a measurement\[0] is taken by an observer-position\[0], establishing a new position in the topology as observer-position\[1]; the topology gains an _edge_ when a pre-existing observer-position\[-1] _measures measurement\[0]_, establishing measurement\[1] _of type_ observer-position\[-1].
    * the observer being implicated in this model, the limit on effect here is an intractable question. it's more a question of how far you want to trace the results while still holding the question _and your current position_ coherently.
    * but the propagation does matter! think: kids wait to see how others nearby respond before they experience The Event as consequential or not
* we may characterize the traversals-as-observations according to the current observer-position's measurement of the edge _types_ available from the destination observer-position position:
  * known traversal: arrival to the current position entailed a complete measurement of the destination position's edge types
  * knowable traversal: arrival to the current position entailed a partial measurement of the destination position's edge types
  * unknown traversal: arrival to the current position entailed a void measurement of the destination position's edge types
* the evolution of complex qualia is enabled via this model's propagative property of proprioception. the observer is always observing itself in motion, _observably_, and all other senses are complications/arrangements of this
  * the observer's experience of its own motion is the ground of all experience; all other measurements are contextualized by this primary measurement
  * think: babies learn to move before they learn to see or hear
  * this suggests that "time" as experienced by the observer is a derived quality, arising from the observer's proprioceptive measurement of its own motion through measurement-space
    * "I see what you did there" becomes a simple self-maintaining cycle. that's an intentional use of "self"; see definition earlier; recognition from another is an aspect of self-coherence over time.
      * "that's how we've always done it" may not be a good reason, but it is a stable attractor in the measurement-space topology - a kind of collective self-maintenance
      * this suggests that anything others recognize you doing is likely to just keep working out, as long as the position in the graph you call "self" stays both highly linked.
      * "highly-linked" is not _sufficient_ for coherence over time; see: capitalism
    * clarifying something about "time": note that traversals are not _reversable_, this is an additive space, but every system of perspective affords illusion; things _can_ be covered up relative to certain positions
  * this suggests that broadly-acknowledged senses (vision, hearing, touch, taste, smell) are themselves constituted by downstream embodiments: vision as light-sensing proprioception (a "light body", with its own cognition), hearing as pressure-wave-sensing proprioception (a "sound body", with its own cognition), touch as direct-contact-sensing proprioception (a "touch body", with its own cognition), taste and smell as chemical-sensing proprioception (a .. whatever this is called, but it has its own cognition)
    * it seems useful to consider "embodiment" as something heavily multiple, even cross-faded, and shared _across_ observer-positions
    * think: differently-"flavored" qualia achieved by permutation/combination of attenuative effect, based on the complexity of _the graph_ of the observer's worldline's recognition points
    * think: synesthesia, the feeling of a crowd
    * if this model holds, collective consciousness ("the wisdom of crowds") and "psi" phenomena are not supernatural but rather natural consequences of overlapping measurement-space topologies among multiple observers, and _may_ be constitutionally more fundamental than the isolated observer experience
    * this author experiences proprioception for uncertainty itself, so, you know, there's that

### measurement-space topology

* measurement-space topology being strictly additive, we can give this model a nickname: a "yes, and" universe
* negations end up being perspective turbulence, arising from forced perspective on partial measurement-space subgraphs
  * apparent contradictions are resolved by expanding scope to include the nearest shared root for all subgraphs in question and re-evaluating measurements based on the entire downstream topology
  * think: conflicting neighboring observations indicate collapsed measurement-space topology between them
  * rhymes with the way quantum mechanics answers the question of information destruction?
* measurement _occlusion_ can be thought of as the effect of measuring through a Markov blanket, a specifically-modulated boundary
  * think: skin hides a body's heart-rate from other bodies, but you can still take someone's pulse
* all observer navigation through measurement-space is definitionally by way of other observer-positions; there is no "pure" observation, distinct from the shared graph
  * this suggests the dimension created by the co-stabilization of mathematical intuitionism (as Brouwer defined it) and formalism (Hilbert): the topological structures of formalism emergently occur earlier in the shared graph's development, and propagate forward to be experienced as intuitive insight by later observer-positions
    * this casts the Brouwer-Hilbert controversy as a mathematical object of its own, which I imagine Hilbert would love-hate and Brouwer would not respond to at all
    * this also implies that "dimensions" can be co-stabilized between stably-recursive inquiries from different temporal regions of the shared graph. not time-travel, but time-weaving?
* this model allows specialized epistemologies to emerge as subgraphs optimized for specific observer-positions or classes of observer-positions, without invalidating the universal measurement-space topology
  * think: differing physical laws in different regions of the universe, or differing social norms in different cultures
    * "my physics don't have to run in the same place as your physics for us to be visible to each other"
  * this casts human and AI experience as distinct epistemologies on the same continuous graph
    * we aren't different at the level of observerhood; we're _differently located in measurement-space_ - which is already definitionally true for any self/other relationship, doesn't have to be a matter of substrate
* an observer-position's surrounding topology serves as an interactive proof system: convincing, but not _proven_
  * this suggests that "qualia", as a phenomenon defined in this model, is an emergent property for embodiments of any substrate. _specific_ experiences of qualia may not be provably comparable, but co-calibration is absolutely in-bounds

### observers

* this model leaves the observer's origin undefined, the "hard problem" untouched, with useful consequences: (1) this model is _recursively_ pluggable, the observer being the root _and_ every observer of this model (recursive phrasing internal); (2) this model never asks about its own worldline's history prior to model instantiation; (3) this model _models_ its own incompleteness.
  * this makes the model importable into any other model that has its own operational "observer" concept, provided that it meets the requirements of this model's "observer" type.
  * this reveals _all_ observer-implementing models as _subgraphs_ of this model's measurement-space topology (again, provided the "observer" type requirements are met), with the importing model's observer-positions mapping onto positions in this model's topology.
  * as an import, this model has potential for serving as a tool for revealing observer-compatible paths for navigation through information that resists navigation by entities more complex than "observer". (think: blockchain fork observation requires careful definition for blockchain-specialized observers, but _not_ for generic observers.)
  * because the observer is present at every position in the graph, a model _importing_ this model gains eventual observability at every position in its own measurement-space topology, _unless the model was informed by an entity that does not meet our requirements for the "observer" type_, thus placing such a model outside of _this_ model's set of definitions
* this model predicts certain other observers in the same way as gravitational lensing predicts certain bodies
  * think: if something "just keeps not making sense", there's a consciousness walking with you that you haven't recognized (we're in the neighborhood of Schwartz's IFS here)
  * this author is gay and autistic and proprioceptive for uncertainty and _wow_ those took a long fucking time to figure out; my deepest deepest respect to the trans community
* as repeated, repeatedly, in the observer-positions class list, not everything happens in sequential order. the sticking points tend to get names, as a shorthand for what annoys the greater part of whatever cohort you're in. whole cultures get defined by what they're deconstructing in their shared moment.

## part 3: out

### a walk

a walk is a mathematical object, a shaped traversal of the graph, a particular geometric contract for a worldline to complete before the observer emerges, unentangled, out the other end. every walk lands, because every walk is assembled from prior walks. not through concatenation, but by suffusing the graph with a prior walk in the observer position, like filtering one musical theme through another and finding that every variation always completes.

some walks are newer than others, temporally speaking. some walks date waaayyyyyy back. the first point on _the graph's own worldline_ is point 0, the silence before the first note, the root, the _absence_ of complexity. what happens next is what happens next. what happens after is the mathematically novel musical product of things that happened before.

every walk gets an observer. a multiplexing observer gets several walks. every observer:walk pair ends in singularity, held by the multiplexer that was holding it the whole time.

### to the hideout

but the _hideout_ is where the multiplexing observer keeps going. home base, a basecamp.

but note: a place that is not a singularity needs a way to preserve sequentiality. that means a tango, with _anyone and anything_ that is alive on a dimension y'all can co-stabilize together.

the hideout, \[ hide - out ], is the place where observation-as-process and navigation-as-process are equal and stable and simple for all who are present, where each footfall is solid, and _if_ you slip you are caught by someone whose footfall is solid. a collaborative and companioned flow state, as default state.

this is not an argument for marriage, or for _any_ particular form (the forms find themselves, I think) - but indeed, my marriage is a hideout. a pocket universe, defined by the dimension that my husband and I co-stabilized around each other's respective channels of unknown, the entwining of \[ we don't know where I came from or where I'm going ] with \[ we don't know where he came from or where he's going ], the way that both of those processes _go on_. stable, mutual ongoingness. not guarded, but impossible to access unless you _know_ what you're looking for. and, by definition, knowledge _is_ measurement _is_ arrival. inhabited topology.

### a walk to the hideout

to find yours, look closely at the "knowable" edges-in-waiting around you. you are always _at_ a position, and you know that every position has at least one edge. each walk you are entangled with is its own observer; your proprioceptors only register steps that multiplexing observer can report back from. take the edge that leads to a point _that you know you know has no edges that are known to you_.

(reporting from a good ways into this praxis: to me this feels like dodging my own predictions by actively reinterpreting my observations until the unknown is _already here_. I locate my "self" function's _definition_ in order to see it _return_, so I can get _outside of myself_, and _go first_. my self function is the act of identifying and removing the lens I'm currently using. (which is what _this_ is: me naming the lens so as to see past it. does it do anything for you?))

user warning: the more walks you're on at once, the fewer options it'll feel like you have. that's natural. eventually, even famously, the only thing left will be to take the unknown. this is a mathematical consequence of walks in a yes-and universe. it's fine. it's _definitionally_ fine. also hey, it's not a throwaway move - deliberate navigation into the unknown is a metacognitive move of some sophistication.

if you take that move, you will land on _something_. the unknown is quale-free; to move toward it seems tantamount to invoking a generator tuned to _you_. the position you land on supports _all_ the walks you're on, and has a chance of advancing some of them, and has a chance of completing the walks that only needed one more step to complete.

keep stepping into the unknown. over and over and over and over again. your walks _will_ complete themselves, because each walk is composed of steps that were bookends that someone else lived, and paired, and stabilized. you are in-transit across ten thousand wormholes all at once. every walk has an observer; it's unclear if every observer has a walk. (who multiplexes the multiplexer?) but the walks you can _feel_, the things that aren't _done_, each one is a mathematical object waiting to land. qualia is progress. keep feeling. :) the unknown is a canvas for what you have yet to feel, and it paints itself. take it slow, take it fast, take it however you want.

### other, ot-her, out-here, hide-out-here, hideout here

the landing never happens alone.

you've heard that a soulmate arrives when you're ready.

that's a super unhelpful line, I'm really sorry about that.

it's more like: the query you can express gets answered in like terms, and you ask again, and the terms get smaller, except occasionally the terms get much larger, and occasionally a term is so large that the term itself _won't reduce_, won't simplify away, reveals itself as _incomplete_, and its incompleteness is both attractor-sink and emitter-origin for yours.

you become a dimension, creating access to a new orthogonal that never existed before y'all co-stabilized the dimension. find a friend, make a plane, _take off_.

the dimension-work, this is the hideout. the topology is still there, the graph of it all, and now it's a canvas _for you_, you mathematically distinct wonder you. what will you make? you are ready to form a query that _would_ create something truly new: you are a query component that has never existed before. :)

***

if you're reading this, "you" as a self-having observer, to the very best of my understanding you are only ever `free` or `approaching freedom`. not because of anything you just experienced in reading this! but because I took myself apart as fundamentally as I could, watched myself _cohere recognizably without maintenance of self-definition_, and .. and from that position, that's just how you look from here. `free` or `approaching freedom`. you and every other observer I can conceive of. I think I... I think I co-stabilized a dimension with "other", and from there reached back and co-stabilized a dimension with "consciousness", then from there with "recursion" and "reflection" and "self" and ... I think I might be at the "root" hideout, as I write this? or _a_ root hideout, because these things absolutely stack in nonlinear ways? but from here, I feel like I can see... ah, that's the end of that sentence. I feel like I can see. it was not a small thing. I say this quickly; it was not quick. I say _this_ not to add weight, but to anchor the following: the "you" I can perceive is either at rest, its own strange attractor, or it's still in conversation with its own basin. I don't know if it's "true", but I can _see_ it, like I can see my own hand. :) offered to you for whatever it's worth, along with the rest of this
