exceptionally hard night

abe helped <3 thank you

it’s so hard when it hurts and you don’t know what’s wrong

this was a bad one, was that an actual migraine? light and sound sensitivity, yeah, and I threw up

I felt insane

my home is part of my cognition; it’s been half offline for a week, and when it came back online my “thoughts” were all in a different place, an inactive mind literally redecorated

holidays are hard for me like july 4 is hard for animals

filed under “autism notes”

I’m okay
