tetris as metaphor for life surface maintenance

prioritizing the accrual of any one type of asset is like prioritizing having a certain color onscreen

you _can_ do it, but

how comfortable do you want to be with the flow of it all?

"tight on x? overpaying x for y? add z and save x!"

there are moves that clear rows, and there are meta-moves that give you possibilities for clearing rows later, if you successfully navigate to a now in which the meta-move is resolved

strategy-stacking requires levels of active awareness

a fully clear surface requires none

choose your own adventure, eh? :)

P.S. My explicit intent (as Isaac) is to navigate to an experience of world in which the world experiences itself as being well.

That's the simplest definition I think I can put forward, toward a definition of success that (1) I can assess and (2) that will actually be useful, something that I'll still want when I get there.

That's my intent. Yours is up to you. :)
