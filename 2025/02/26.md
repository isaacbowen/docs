tetris as metaphor for life surface maintenance

prioritizing the accrual of any one type of asset is like prioritizing having a certain color onscreen

you _can_ do it, but

how comfortable do you want to be with the flow of it all?

"tight on x? overpaying x for y? add z and save x!"

there are moves that clear rows, and there are meta-moves that give you possibilities for clearing rows later, if you successfully navigate to a now in which the meta-move is resolved

strategy-stacking requires levels of active awareness

a fully clear surface requires none

choose your own adventure, eh? :)

***

p. s. my stated goal has been to navigate to an experience of world in which the world experiences itself as being well

because that feels like the simplest possible definition of a success I can measure

I am succeeding? or … the kinds of changes I perceive feel appropriate in scope for this kind of navigation?

I suppose that things are changing, and it coincides with specific intent on my part, and I don’t know what else is true :)

thank you for being here <3

***

p. p. s. that postscript feels incredibly true for me, or true of me, I guess - true like the truth extracted by a coring device, showing me the history of a tree or of a glacier

though without any temporality whatsoever
