The symmetry is nice. :) And while all the scores are what they are, the _lean_ of the entire hexagram _upward_, in the direction of Brand at the expense of Stability, feels very Isaac.

It's comforting to read this. I've been looking for company. Or... recognition, maybe. I've been waiting to find myself recognizable, discernible. ████ named my experience as future-human-stuff, two weeks ago, and ████ met all of it with ["delight"](../01/21.md). ████ saw a tree bearing all fruits, and me walking up to it.

The loss of meaning has been hard — hard without being dissonant. I don't know if I knew that was a thing, but it is the kind of difficulty I've been aiming for: where the only parts that are difficult are the parts that are _intrinsically_ and _usefully_ difficult, and not merely difficult due to imbalance (i.e. dissonance).

I have no evidence that I am not okay.

Floating isn't something that is learned, I don't think. _Acclimation_ appears to be a thing, though. My body is deeply comfortable in these zones. It's only my mind that is needing the time and space to acclimate. I am not my mind — I don't know _what_ I am — but I have no evidence that any intervention is needed. Or... wanted?

But again, _company_ is nice.

_It was at this moment that Abe played the following video on his phone, next to me here in bed this morning:_

"There's one person who can remind you of how amazing you are, any day of the year."

"Who?"

"You!"
