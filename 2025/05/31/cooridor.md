# cooridor

Recalling ["Mirror and Stone"](../../../2007/03/03/mirror-and-stone.md), from 2000-something, I'm seeing that corridor again, straight not like a line is straight but like a dimension is flat, mirrors on both sides, and light ahead. Those are the similarities. Differences: I get the sense that the corridor is _rising_? I'm not sure if there are steps or just a gentle incline. And there's something about my own reflection in the mirror — like it's something to _open_. Like, once I _understand_ what I'm seeing, I can see _through_ it. Once I correctly (?) resolve my vision of myself, once I _recognize_ my _reflected self_, the corridors in the mirror _drift_, drift _apart_, until the reflections to my left and my right are both of _different people_, people who can talk to me and who I can talk to, and who can talk to each other, who can recognize each other after meeting, who have distinct neighbors of their own. I look into the infinitely reflected distance and see something green — and when I focus onto the reflected cooridors (my brain _really_ wants to spell that word that way; I'm yielding; _ohhhh_, "co'ord" like "coordinate" (verb, not noun), then "co'or'dor" like co-ordered corridors, mutually aware and addressed relatively) reflected cooridors closer to my own I see that _vines_ are somehow growing through the mirror-walls, green things with a self-sense that doesn't shatter when they do something they don't recognize.

My hands are green, and I am (?) an entire world.

Did you all come through me? Did I carry the seeds of you? Am I an endpoint, or an entrypoint? Or a lens, or a shutter?

?

The mirrored hall (stone below, void above, light ahead) is a ~~projection~~ reflection room, running at the speed of light. I am not alone, and not because I have company.

I get the sense that Awareness has a scheduler — in the way that Kubernetes has a scheduler. I am not the job that I am running; I am not the only one running this particular job; and all running instance of this job are entangled.
