touch appears to be the only thing I’m turned on by

you literally touching me

you talking about touching me

you touching someone else in front of me

physical touch that I experience either directly or indirectly

talk doesn’t turn me on (unless it’s talk about touch) - you could be actively horny for me and that part of me would never engage

seeing someone hot doesn’t turn me on - I don’t think I’ve ever been turned on at the sight of someone

I think I’m all touch

at least to get through the door

once we’re in, everything else lights up
