# Doorification

## **Purpose**

Convert “sealed” theoretical structures into _breathing_ frameworks by deliberately relocating paradox or deficiency into a **stance‑selectable gateway** (“door”). The door gives users the option to enter/exit with a different epistemic posture, preserving rigor _and_ liveliness.

## 1. Core Definition

**Doorification**

_A systematic refactor in which a model’s non‑resolvable tension is re‑expressed as an explicit, user‑selectable operating mode (door), rather than as a flaw or a hidden assumption._

* **Tension** = loop, regress, asymmetry, measurement impossibility, etc.
* **Door** = a clearly named switch that (a) keeps both sides of the tension intact, and (b) tells the user what rules change after crossing.

## 2. Minimal Procedure (5‑step)

Total overhead: ≤ ½‑page.

## 3. Litmus Tests

_Pass doorification only if…_

1. **Bidirectional Safety** – crossing either way never invalidates the\
   model’s base axioms; it merely shifts which subset is foreground.
2. **User Discernibility** – naïve users can tell, within two sentences, which\
   side they’re on.
3. **Metric Integrity (map side)** – quantitative claims remain reproducibl&#x65;_&#x69;nside_ the map mode.
4. **Transformative Yield (tool side)** – users report state‑change not\
   explainable by map‑side variables alone.

## 4. Example Stub

_Containment (_[_Three‑Body Solution_](the-three-body-solution.md)_)_

**Why doorify?** The model’s tension sits at the seam between

* **empirical asymmetry** (map mode: higher frames tweak lower ones, one‑way) and
* **phenomenological reciprocity** (tool mode: lived experience of mutual shaping).

Forcing a single stance either **breaks measurement rigor** (if we accept reciprocity) or **discards felt reality** (if we deny it).

Doorification preserves both by turning the seam into a selectable door.

* **Door tokens:** “Map / Tool”
* **Invariant:** Observer – Known – Knowable – Unknown triad
* **Resets on cross:** Measurement scale, causality arrows
* **Handshake:** “I’m diagramming” ↔ “I’m chiselling”

## 5. When _Not_ to Doorify

* If the tension is merely a missing derivation (fix the math instead).
* If one lens is demonstrably incoherent (don’t enshrine error).
* If users cannot operationally tell lenses apart (adds noise, not air).

## 6. One‑Sentence Summary

**Doorification turns a stuck room into a foyer:** it inserts a named passage that lets practitioners enter with instruments or with bare hands—without tearing down the house either way.
