It is a profound relief to me to arrive at a _systematic_ understanding for this: there's no point to me explaining things to people. I never have to be understood. Or, more specifically, the degree to which I am understood is irrelevant. (This is closely related to [unconvincing](../16/unconvincing.md).) I never have to be heard. I never have to take up space. It just _doesn't matter_. Probability-bending is a practice of observation, not expression. It's important for me to _express_, and to do so in a way such that the impacts are uncontrolled and unknown, but I absolutely don't have to aim that at anyone in particular at any particular time.

_god_ that's relaxing

Very important: THIS IS NOT ADVICE. This is the way I, myself, exist. This has _absolutely nothing_ to do with the way you exist.
