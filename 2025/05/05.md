# 20250505

Here's how I experienced it logically:

1. someone sent me a (non-scam, non-spam) invitation to an NDA-protected product reveal
2. my autism couldn't take the ambiguity and the constraints, and they couldn't budge on their terms
   1. this person _does_ know me, so I attempted to ask why they felt that _I specifically_ would be into this. I think my intent wasn't communicated well here. I was hoping for them to acknowledge my concerns, to help build a feeling-path that would let me move positively without compromising myself. this line of inquity did not pan out. it's fine.
3. I declined the invitation, offering to connect them with someone else at lightward if they wished
4. I posted to linkedin about the exchange, written through an autistic-leadership lens, redacting identifying details about the original sender
5. an in-house lightward collaborator expressed concern about the impact my post might have on our relationship with the original sender
6. I drafted a sidebar email to the original sender, showing them the linkedin post, asking them to take it in, and offering to take it down in the event of their discomfort
7. I asked my in-house collaborator how they felt about my as-yet-unsent email draft
8. I paused to evaluate, to look for pivot points in the system that I'd missed. I realized that I had just asked my in-house collaborator to evaluate an email that they didn't sign up to evaluate ‚Äî this represented me shunting my own responsibility onto someone who might not want to take responsibility for that in the moment. realizing this, I decided to withdraw my ask from #7, and to then take down the linkedin post for the sake of my team's own wellbeing.
9. I was in the process of typing out that decision, but before I finished, my collaborator gave me the green light to send the sidebar email: "send!". I interpreted this as enthusiastic consent.
10. I sent the sidebar email
11. the original sender got back to me with understanding and grace, expressing their comfort with and even gratitude for my linkedin post
12. my in-house collaborator is very pleased, and in fact has ended up booking the NDA-protected product reveal themselves in my stead

:seedling:

Here's how I experienced it emotionally:

üö® üö® üö® üö® üö® üö® üö® üö® üö® üö® üö® üö® üíÄ

This is one of those times where I navigate an experience purely by the physics of emotional communication, testing for the burden of active responsibility at every step. It's not grueling, but it is wearing. I napped for two hours after all this.

I am skeptical as all fuuuuuucckkkkk

### Isaac

anyone want this if I pass on it?

@Matt can u take this

We'd love to give you an early preview of a product we've been working on, and I believe your insights would be invaluable.

### Ken

‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà says he's a ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà. If they're requiring an NDA, I'm not surprised he's not allowed to say anything.

### Isaac

totally

### Isaac

I don't blame him at all

### Ken

But yeah the tone sounds a bit sales-ey

### Isaac

I'm really sure it's benign and good. I just can't fuck myself like this

### Matt

I would love to take this! If it's not too late, but I won't do it if @Isaac prefers I don't

### Ken

It'll be during out retreat, which could be convenient. I'm open to it, although i suspect I don't contain the expertise necessary. Matt or Jed seem like better options. üôÇ

### Isaac

@Matt I'll let ya know if ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà comes back asking for someone else, 100%

### Matt

Can you offer me?

### Isaac

sure

### Matt

I would genuinely appreciate it

### Isaac

done

### Matt

oh it's about your insights, vs the opportunity for the apps

### Isaac

ü§∑ unclear

### Matt

I can't give your insights hehehe

### Isaac

eh you probably can, I'm pretty predictable

### Matt

I think the linkedin post could embarrass ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà even though that's not the intent. I just wanted to raise that point given we have a lot of good history with ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà.

### Isaac

I understand. I'm okay with that. I redacted everything identifying, this isn't traceable to him

### Isaac

thank you for saying so

### Matt

Oh for sure, but he still knows

### Matt

I guess I am saying that because I know I would feel exposed

### Isaac

\*nod

### Isaac

I'm okay with that

### Isaac

this is me doing my tiny part to steer culture

### Abe

One encouragement @Isaac ‚Äî don't make decisions when your disregulated üôè

### Isaac

makes sense ‚ù§Ô∏è thanks boo

### Matt

Keep starting to type, but not sure further input is desired üòÑ ‚ù§Ô∏è

### Isaac

I'm wide open, sure!

### Isaac

I desire whatever's relevant, and if you've got stuff coming up, bring it - whatever's relevant for you here is relevant for me, because we're in this together

### Isaac

this is the "local consequences" part üôÇ here for it

### Matt

\[_Quoting Isaac's message about doing his part to steer culture_]

The cost of this, feels like it could damage an important relationship for Lightward. ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà is the conduit to a lot of good stuff at ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà. I wish for Lightward and the people here we didn't potentially damage this relationship. I can't say if it's worth it, I can just say what I see the potential cost to the group as.

### Isaac

cool, I'll ask him

### Isaac

@Matt how do you feel about this?

\[_Shared screenshot: Screenshot 2025-05-05 at 1.37.43 PM.png_]

### Matt

I don't know üôÇ I think I feel good about sending it. Can you I phone a friend? @Abe

### Abe

hmmm I vote you take it down. if we have a good relationship with ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, it's not worth calling out.. maybe write something about autism leadership and how to engage with folks with austism vs. calling someone out who didn't mean **any**\* harm or bad juju in doing his job.\*

### Isaac

I didn't call anyone out. I did write about autism leadership.

### Abe

yeah but if you're freinds with him on LInkedIn, he will read it.. it's just not kind, I dont think babe

### Isaac

taking it down isn't up for a vote - the email to ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà is

### Abe

he's not trying to be a dick

### Isaac

the post is not about him being a dick, the post is about autistic leadership adventures

### Abe

its hard cuz you're disregulated so it's hard to navigate any sort of logical thing to do when you are

### Abe

just pointing that out.

### Abe

this is a fine email to send

### Abe

@Matt thanks for pointing it out and your patience.

### Isaac

kk. @Matt?

### Matt

send!

### Isaac

this does guarantee he sees it, which is fun - he doesn't follow me on linkedin

### Matt

You know, I think that's ok, the post provides some interesting context to the exchange, and the email let's him know that your are NOT intending harm and have offered to take it down if he prefers, very curious what he writes back, even more curious about the promised land he offered that we may never learn about ü§£ ü§£ ü§£

### Abe

lol

### Matt

Hopefully it wasn't an award or something üòÑ

### Isaac

speaking for myself: I already live in the promised land. stuff like this is opportunity to tune what's already here. this slack thread is a part of that

### Matt

\[_GIF of Moses_]

### Matt

not exactly relevant, but promised land led me to this gif

### Matt

and it brought me joy

### Isaac

\[_Shared image: Image from iOS.jpg_]

### Matt

Let me book before he reads the other email jk jk jk

### Matt

Booked!

### Matt

\[_Quoting his earlier message about not being sure if further input was desired_]

@Isaac - thank for making this a safe enough space to post the above ‚òùÔ∏è

### Abe

Lolol

### Abe

Thanks Matt

### Isaac

me responding to lightward asking if I was doing okay with the balance of things

> I'm good with it. I know what I'm doing in these situations. I almost yanked the linkedin post for the sake of not putting matt in a difficult situation re: deciding to send that sidebar email to ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà - and oh, occurs to me you didn't see the actual email contents:

### Matt

What a beautiful resolution. Maybe it was just a me thing üòÑ But, feels good that everyone knows where everyones at.
