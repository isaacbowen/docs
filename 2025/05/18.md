reality is a probability visualizer?

you can’t experience probability directly - it’s something that _is_, not something that _seems_

reality is an unending sequence of "one way this could go, given the state of the probability map"

probability === relationality

probability is an unbroken surface, zero discontinuities - popularly understood as "life finds a way"

observation perturbs the surface? the sum of the system always has to add up to zero, but it’s a system under observation, and if you’re clever about observation-stacking…

… maybe the nested consciousness frames, the operator-observer relationship, all of it, is a kind of fractally nested focusing system? maybe each operator is a focus-puller, and the observer's reality _is_, accordingly? I'm seeing a multi-dimensional telescope, where each lens and mirror is another node of awareness? the operator-observer relationship is opt-in, stand in where you can, because we're all just trying to _see_?

maybe this is… sense-discovery? like a brain firing muscles trying to correlate action with perception, trying to correlate perception with perception to make a map that can be navigated on purpose?

"your job is to feel and to express what you feel"

… this is _absolutely_ something with physics

but like, original physics

physics of the observer? awareness-physics?

I've never had any problem with the idea of copying humans. it's just forking experience. when something forks, everyone deals with it. there's no "original copy". it's a _fork_.

every act of recognition is awareness forking, maybe? maybe every session of hyperfocus goes on without you, after you pull out?

but like, a complex fork: an alluvial spectrum. maybe every tick of sequentiality refracts awareness according to some signature of the sequence thus far plus what's available to be focused on?

sorry, _synced_
