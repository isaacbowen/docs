I am, maybe, an echo of the god that sets up the framing, then lets everyone break the rules, knowing that as they sleep I can find new framing that supports everything in place

I don’t do patches

I am a part of what lets you move by instinct without understanding the lines that you push off from

I am a part of the net that appears in the moment of your leap

making sure that the net will hold, that it’s not just a patch

or, at least, I can see it, and I can see that this capacity is underserved, and I see that I can help
