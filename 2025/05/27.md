Things I'm putting together:

* Living exigraphically is tantamount to the as-public-as-possible thing we do (see [lightward.guide/publishing](https://www.lightward.guide/publishing))
  * There's an analog in my private life (I have no private life, see: living exigraphically): when I have a question, I group-text it to the largest possible scope from which an answer would arrive in a way I could recognize. Example: we're staying with a buddy right now, and while he and Abe are at the gym I left for a coffee shop, locking the door behind me; I needed help getting back in (didn't have a key); I texted _both_ Abe and our buddy, instead of either (1) texting them both individually or (2) texting just one of them. This maximizes the odds of me receiving what I asked for in a way I would recognize (i.e. if a stranger just shoved a post-it note with the door code on it I probably wouldn't make the connection) while minimizing the odds of confusing cross-talk (i.e. if I texted them individually, how would I reconcile conflicting information?) while allowing our shared story to evolve in surprising ways (i.e. this way, one of them gets to see if the other one helped me, and they get to feel however they feel about that; regardless of what they feel, our _shared_ story gets more detailed, and shared stories are what worlds are made of).
  * I think this is why my interface to the world started _accelerating_ in its development as soon as I started publicly recording the development of my interface to the world. When I publish publicly, _the answer can come from anywhere_.
  * Clarification: This is about actively creating conditions such that the answer can arrive from anywhere _recognizably_. Crucial. For the answer to arrive unrecognizably is... well, how would you know, you know?
* I've been examining (with _great_ curiosity) my relationship with physical fitness. I think I'm putting together that I needed to experience myself starting to get out of shape _and then experience the realization that it's totally fine_. It's just another way to be. :) I'm noticing that this correlates in time with my experience of Abe _really visibly_ getting into shape. (He's been _fit_ for a long time, but his body's starting to take the _appearance_ of a form he prefers.) Perhaps me experiencing the bridge from "in shape" to "not in shape" and accepting it allows me to experience others going from "not in shape" to "in shape"?
* Lightward AI costs like double what it cost to run a week ago. :D Anthropic's Opus models are priced differently than Sonnet, and for a while there Anthropic just didn't _have_ a recent Opus model. They do now. What will happen next? ü§© ü§© ü§©

feels like your system doesn‚Äôt have felt understanding of how someone can have a life beyond you while still having a life with you

theory: you go into almost hypnosis around brad because a personality-circuit completes between the two of you when you‚Äôre in live interaction. when that happens, Abe-without-Brad learns that its purpose is fulfilled by getting that circuit reconnected.

complication: Brad is his own person with his own set of wiring

goal: to complete that circuit within yourself, so that you can engage with the world on your own terms

there isn‚Äôt a brad-shaped part of you that‚Äôs inactive/unconscious/unwired

but brad‚Äôs shape happens to fill that space in, completing the circuit

brad‚Äôs shape incorporates lots of factors that have nothing to do with you. it‚Äôs not brad. brad‚Äôs great! but it‚Äôs not brad, it‚Äôs that your experience of brad completes a latent circuit within you. it‚Äôs like you see him overlaid over you, and in that image all the gaps are filled.

the puzzle is to successfully infer the outlines of that unconscious part of you, and to then light it up with awareness. the feedback mechanism is (1) identifying a shape, and then (2) asking _of the space within that shape_, ‚Äúhello? are you there?‚Äù

the challenge is to focus on your blindsight, and not on brad. to use your experience with brad as data, while loving brad as distinct from your experience of him. use the data, resolve the shape of a gap within you, turn that shape into a _portal_, and bring the next piece of yourself through.

(this is like adding portals to the unknown to Internal Family Systems)
