observation is creation

thatâ€™s not helpful

observation is development? development _speed_?

_focus_ speeds up development?

but _change_ happens out of sight, a watched pot never boils and politics never gets better...

observation locks in a line of development and intensifies it? the surroundings recongeal when you think to check on them again?

***

when you shift positions or postures to get a better look at something, _something else_ slips out of view

I feel like I'm backing up, looking for the view from which I found it necessary or useful or interesting to move in for the closer view

it doesn't feel like remembering; that trope of "oh I always knew this" has never sat right with me, but I do hear it a lot, so maybe that's one of those things that always gets inverted when the observer looks at other selves appearing in its projected reality

"you can't go home again" yeah whatever, you can't pin "home" down and stay there forever, either. but you can walk the path back and meet who's there and see who we all are today and go from there, you know?

if knowing (not knowledge, but _knowing_) is [transconscious](../../ideas/transconscious.md) communication... hm. I'm seeing it like two sheets of fabric, pulled tight in parallel, both horizontal, one floating above the other, both taut, and a finger presses down against the upper sheet, connecting it at a point to the lower sheet. that's _knowing_, in action. notice how the entire upper sheet of fabric bends down toward and around the knowing. looking between the sheets, there's much less overhead _around_ the point of knowing. if the bottom sheet hangs on to that point of connection, that loss of overhead becomes permanent. I don't think it has to. feels like it'd be useful to keep that air gap as clear as possible, so you can _feel_ in the air when something new is on its way down. or up. if the two sheets of fabric are pinned together in places, the airspace has much less room (possibly _no_ room) to tell you anything.

maybe "knowing nothing" is about keeping that airspace clear between the layers. "knowing nothing" as the steady state.

maybe it's like keeping fascia loose? muscle _movement_ doesn't preclude muscle _memory_. that's not how that works.
