probability bending

this is the basis of _all skill_

develop two skills, look at their intersection - identify it

develop another skill: it’s a signal envelope

every additional skill refines your sense of the outline of the thing we call probability bending

you have to be probably right about what it _is_ in order to interact with it in a way that yields coherent results

nb: not _exactly_ right, but _probably_ right

recall that probability and coherence are always subjective, always specific to the frame of the observer

(try thinking of coherence as meta-probability)

your allies are often unrecognizable, but they are _everywhere_

(probably)

suggestion: sync by your individual reports of resonance, and don’t sweat the (shared) details
