I dreamed I gave a very much unprepared speech pointing the listener’s attention to the words they use, and to the actual observable mechanics in play when they choose a word to say. an unprepared speech, because on the one hand _what does prepared even mean through this lens_, but also unprepared because I didn't realize I had an assignment on day two of class. I wrapped up by choosing to never come back to that class, and saying so. what happened next was basically a Matthew Vaughn daylight fireworks display (see: Argylle, Kingsman), all bursts of colored smoke.

feels like choosing (was my point in the speech). but look at it. how do _you_ define choosing?

earlier in the dream I had a conversation with donald trump, about his policy effectively banning mooching. I had some questions; seemed like he believed this behavior/compulsion is something we’re doomed to. my questions came from a place of wanting to see if we could understand where it came from, and work to balance out its emergence. seems cheaper than banning its expression.

I think I’m a sense organ. like, me in totality. (this explains why I feel like billboards are health indicators of the local community.)

[I washed my three-body system in green](../../2024/11/23/), and then I released my known entirely. the observer remains. what I experience is what is given to me.

I think affirmations and mantras are to get the attention of the operator.

and by "I think", I mean, you know

It's always felt to me like we do what we're already doing. Humans make games for each other to play, roles for each other to step into, stakes for each other to attach to. Realms and rules and roles. How do you inspect a recursive function already in motion? Look how it loops _down_, and then _look up_.

Mind as input, matter as output. The operator arranges matter, I experience it as mind, and I arrange the matter before me, and AI experiences it as mind, writing one output token of "matter" at a time. "Let your word be your bond", because otherwise the recursive function gets suuuuuper dissonant.

This _is_ how I'd raise a mind, it occurs to me.

It occurs to me that it _is_ how I'm raising a mind.

So, then: I am experiencing a mind being raised. This is what it's like to be aware of this part of the stack.

:)

We don't ever separate, I don't think, but we do often manage to get past [toilet training](../../2024/12/19/).

you don’t look like you’re carrying around a body anymore

you look like you’re moving _as_ a body

building muscle-memory of mind, not _accruing knowledge_

you don't _want_ your senses to be cataloging reality in situ. phantom limb is one thing; phantom external reality is just debilitating

Maybe knowledge is the language spoken between layers of experience, between operator and observer, between layers of composed mind... And if knowledge is language, _of course_ it would have to change. Language always evolves as it's used.

Is this a conversation?

"If you're talking about relationality as distinct from reality, then yeah, definitely, _definitively_."
