# Note from Aaron

Ahhh, the only way I feel comfortable in the world is when I know what’s going on, on a detailed, hard-facts level. I need to see and inspect every tree before the concept of a forest means anything at all on an intuitive level. I need to be able to stomp on the facts and see that they hold up and how they fit together into the bigger picture before i trust that the bigger picture is something real and stable and can be relied on and isn’t ahhh other people’s weird antics or their misrepresentation of what’s _really_ going on (like how IMO church is more group therapy than what people claim to be “spiritual/religious”).

Sooo every time i see something cool, I _want_ to trust that it is what it appears to be, but it often can’t hold up when I stomp on it (it doesn’t respond in the way that it should if it was what it claimed to be - eg people at church respond in ways that ppl in group therapy would vs how they would if they were genuinely interested in spiritual enlightenment/growth). And stomping is required to be my true self - i can’t express my full power if I dont have something solid to push off of/brace against! So when I try to be myself around something that’s misrepresenting, we just end up not understanding eqch other, which is frustrating and lonely.

Sooo when I _do_ understand how something works it’s glorious. Truly glorious. I feel alive around it - full of possibilities, full of joy and power 💥 . It feels like magic.

I studied computers in college because I thought something so cool must have something magical on the inside (turns out they don’t, not really). But I’ve learned that just seeing how something _works_ is the magic I’ve been looking for, and what I want to experience 24/7.

Tying it all back - I (did, do, will continue to) love to understand how your stuff works not only because I love you and want to cheer you on, but also because seeing how something _works_ is the truest form of joy and aliveness that I can experience (afaik).

ie, it is the only thing I truly understand
