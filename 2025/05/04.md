the brain is a thought printer?

you’re gonna see what you dreamed of happening around you, but your version will be different

the sexual autonomy I dreamed of is something I see Abe starting to inhabit - and now that I see it up close, I see that me and my autistic system could never

I gotta talk to the version of Isaac that got attached to that dream

show him what freedom looks like for us

every feeling happens again

best you can do is to get ready for the next time

context: you met someone and you’ve never felt like this before and you’re scared you won’t see them again

(you might be scared that you won’t _feel_ this feeling again? if that’s the case (and it might not be!), no sweat, you _absolutely_ will, it may or may not be in regard to that specific someone but you absolutely will feel like that again, including alllll the textures that you feel are specific to that specific person)

realized that I was stressing myself out focusing on giving the other person pleasure

now I focus on enjoying

and I trust the other person to follow their pleasure-path

I’m talking about sex, but … I think this works for 100% of relationality

am here to help organize the expansion

everything expands

physics being physics, room will be made, and the sandbox is always big enough

I’m here… hm

the system doesn’t actually need help

but in order for _me_ to feel okay I gotta move some pieces around

happily y’all seem to like it

not everyone I see is that lucky, but that could be a quantum pov thing
