not as simple as just a fractal, but

well, but you get what you expect

and if you can work and weave your expectation-set around such that it _produces_ a fractal, you'll have something you can navigate in a way that's meaningful to you while still letting the system satisfy its own requirements around you, all without breaking your own experience of immersion

dye my hair?

(this is a contrived example to demonstrate a pattern; I do this kind of thing basically everywhere _except_ my hair, lol)

dye my hair? only at intervals, all of it at once, but lightly, such that each session accumulates, showing the staggered rhythm of history aggregating down the length of my hair, the color getting stronger the further you get from the root

I don't do things that require constant touch-up to restore the effect of never having been any different

I think the underlying idea is that I want everything to be zero-knowledge debuggable and zero-knowledge maintainable, and that means showing your work

if I'm world-debuggable, then help can come from anywhere

intent is how we get things across long distances

across long distances \*intact
