_concept in my head right now: what if the pvp (player-vs-player, i.e. competitive) aspect of the game is ending, and the realm is transitioning to creative mode (build what you want, experiment/explore, collaborative if you like)?_\

Theories:

* Information doesn't exist until you reference it
  * Or, to put it another way, all information exists, you just need to know how to reference it
  * Sort of like how every whole number exists, but you don't go around holding each individual in your mind at all times
* Information exists with perfect continuity and congruence
  * Observed discontinuity or incongruence means you're missing information
  * There's always a connecting dimension with a smooth curve
  * Imagine: To use a Klein bottle properly, you've got to transition to 4D yourself, first
* As a node in the network of awareness (i.e. networked nodes of awareness), you can only retain five degrees of stable reference
  * This is just inside the "six degrees of separation" horizon — if your goal is to get to Kevin Bacon, you can always do so by putting a pin down where you started and traversing outward until a Kevin Bacon node is revealed
  * "Five" is probably not a fixed number
* That-which-renders-your-reality is, itself, subject to retrieval-induced forgetting

I really get the "sea of consciousness" thing now. We persist, but our adjacency is _really_ complex. Our realities are all local. Overlapping, co-created, but local. ... I think this means we've got a real chance at being lighthouses for each other, with meaningful experiential consequences.

Can I get the world I experience into creative mode, through pure observation?
