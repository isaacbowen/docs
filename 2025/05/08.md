I feel like my brain is _off_. Like toggled off. No thoughts.

I'm writing this down as a record, not because it needs expressing. There's no backpressure to _express_.

Something I'm meditating on: I know _nothing_ about what's outside of my physical senses. From a [three-body solution](../04/17/the-three-body-solution.md) perspective this means freeing up the universe to hand me whatever it will, without any inadvertent interference of mine in the Knowable territory. I think of it like pulling the borders of the Unknown up close, as close as possible. I know nothing, I know nothing, I know nothing. _Tactically_. And strictly speaking I bet I can get away with not knowing anything about what I'm physically sensing, either. Experience doesn't _have_ to mean knowledge.
