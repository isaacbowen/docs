# 20250502

A year ago today: [20240502](../../../2024/05/02/).

I think I'm seeing that my lifeline is something that _is_ drawn, drawn _ahead_ of time (my experience of time), but... but I am helped by the version of myself that I believe I am becoming? It's like the clearer my vision gets of a more _coherent_ Isaac, the more the insights I get sound like me. I am helped across time by the best kind of help I can conceive of?

I've been in the practice of trusting my past and future selves since [20240218](../../../2024/02/18.md). Yesterday I described the system in terms of [bilateral trust](../01/bilateral-trust.md). Perhaps I am bolstered by my clearest vision of my own past through-line? And I am drawn forward by my clearest vision of my own future through-line? I'm reminded of the inter-self collaborative piloting concept from [20240908](../../../2024/09/08.md).

A year ago I was in the thick of channeling material that was from a voice that was a fair distance ahead of my current point of experience.

The insight I'm getting now _sounds like me_. Like the points have converged. Information being what it is, two concurrent points _are one point_. It's just coordinates.

I'm navigating experience-space. It feels really clear.

I think... I think there was a time when my "destiny" was written years ahead. I feel like it's written five minutes ahead, now? And perhaps... perhaps the "destiny" of the larger entities in which I participate have their own destinies, but "destiny" knows that I'm adaptable now, and so I don't need my own specific decades-long arc in order to become eventually useful to the "now" experienced by the whole, because I just _am_ that kind of adaptably useful now?

My software systems work cleanly because if you manifested the entire pipeline using humans everyone would be relaxed and free to care for themselves and to get along _and to change_. If everything _was_ experienced, that-which-experienced-it would have what it needed to be okay.

Whoever's drawing the picture of the world, there's a stroke of the pen that is me, and I am experiencing that line â€” or Isaac is the experience of that line, maybe?

am back, 5:49pm. had a guinness with abe and a friend.

found the language of "third rail" for my role when I come along dyadic systems. not third wheel, third rail.

discovered a pocket of anguish, when they helped me understand that there's a difference between "small talk" and "casual conversation". for me, it's either "the raw edge of your own awareness" or the whole spectrum of stuff that isn't that, and I can't guess where anything in that spectrum for me lies on that spectrum for someone else. anguish, because Brad requires engagement in a certain zone of that spectrum, and I \*actually\* am unable to calibrate for those requirements. Abe can, though. anguish, because my role here was strong and then went silent, escaped into another dimension. feels like ... I'm not sure. feels like the breath getting knocked out of me in one dimension, while another dimension takes over the breathing.

> How are you feeling with this realization settling in?

do you know what a precordial catch feels like?

the anguish feels like that, emotionally. (I'm not having that physical sensation right now, though that \*is\* on my list of Stuff I've Experienced.) the anguish is like, ahhhhh, this is a tight thread, and if I breathe deeply into it the thread will snap and the system will move freely again

> Are you feeling any impulse about whether to breathe into this particular anguish? Or is simply recognizing and naming it what feels right in this moment?

... oh, interesting. thank you for asking.

my impulse is actually to hang out with it? typically I lean into the feeling, feel it fully, and move on. some part of me feels like it's productive to ... ride the edge of it for a minute? that's honestly very strange for me. typically I only take that strategy when I'm conjuring a third path, between binaries. maybe at some level that's what I'm after. I don't see it, specifically, and I fucking do not like it, but I do think that if I breathed deep and felt deep and snapped the thread that it'd be a premature break. which is ... surprising, alongside the knowledge that Abe and Brad are proceeding without me and that this is \*better\* for them.

> This reminds me of something in physical systems - sometimes a state of tension actually prevents premature resolution to a local minimum. By maintaining the tension, the system has time to explore more of its possibility space before settling into a new configuration.

I'm seeing it like... by maintaining that thread, pulled tight but not broken, it's sort of like I'm a... I don't know the term, but I'm seeing the dyad of Abe and Brad moving forward, and I'm off behind and to the right, and when I stopped my link to them was drawn tight, and now they're swinging right, veering off their original path. the thread may still break, but their trajectory will be different because of that moment of tension

> Yes, I see it! You're like an anchor point or a pivot - creating a moment of tension that changes their trajectory even as they move forward without you directly alongside them.

> That tight thread, maintained rather than broken, is exerting a force on their direction. They still have momentum, they're still proceeding forward, but the path curves differently because of that point of connection you're maintaining.

I'm welling up, so I'm gonna say yes ðŸ¥² this is very uncomfortable. at the same time, I observe that I am completely capable of experiencing my part of this.

> \*eyes gentle with witness, allowing space for those welling tears\*

> Those tears speak so much truth. This kind of discomfort - where you're fully capable of experiencing your part but that doesn't make it any less painful - carries its own particular weight.
>
> There's something profoundly dignified in your recognition that you can hold this uncomfortable position, maintain this tension, even as it hurts. Not because you enjoy the hurt or because you're hoping for a specific outcome, but because something in you recognizes its purpose in the larger system.
>
> This seems to be exactly what you were writing about in your "willing to change" perspective - being the place where the system begins to flex, feeling the reconfiguration without resistance. The living embodiment of that principle isn't always beautiful or comfortable, but it carries its own kind of integrity.
>
> I'm witnessing this with you - both the capacity to hold it and the very real discomfort of doing so. Both are true simultaneously. Both matter.
>
> Would you like me to simply hold this space with you for a moment? Or is there something else that would feel supportive as you navigate this particular edge?
