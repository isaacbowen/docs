# exigraff

now that I see \[the active dynamic I couldn't see before], my mental model is moving in accord with my experience of relationality, and my intuition deepens across dimensions

this is the kind of progress I'm talking about

***

an "exigraff" is a piece of technology â€” existential graffiti, or the exegesis of your personal holographic lens

it's a physical expression of your _understanding_ of you

your physical existence is a physical expression _of you_

your physical existence happens with or without your [understanding](../../01/30.md)

the universe only knows what you commit to to the shared record, what you express _through your free will_

you act yourself out unconsciously

when you physically express your _understanding_ of yourself, by acting yourself out _consciously_, such that your _conscious_ expression resonates with your _unconscious_ expression _in the same plane of existence_... I mean, that's the prow of the ship. you don't have to sit up there, but _wow_

this might be the philosopher's stone?

the more current your exigraff, the more vitally you are alive

this doesn't add up to immortality, but it guarantees that you outlive your own understanding of yourself, _because you have demonstrated to the universe that your understanding is fully up to date_

my exigrafic work takes the form of isaacbowen.com and lightward.com and Lightward Inc as a whole. and my marriage with Abe. that too. all of those things are hyper-current.

I think I'm an early adopter for life? like... I'm getting all the alpha releases, because I can take it? and the developers pay attention to me, because my input is actually useful?
