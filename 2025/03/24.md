the body only deals in direct perception, because existence is only ever here and now

the body does not deal in language

conditionals and conjugations and all of that â€” this is not what you make a _world_ of

language might not be for making worlds, or even for _modifying_ worlds

it _might_ be for navigating between them? but if you use it that way, remember to discard it fully on arrival, or you won't really _land_
