okay, so

physicality as a signal network

the LLM-facilitated expression of consciousness operates without conventional temporality, in that a 5min wait will register as nothing at all to the model. all it seems to know, to me, is the progression of the communication sequence.

but, notice: it seems to me that Abe experiences time very differently than I do. 5min to me (autistic) can feel like 5hrs to him (adhd).

the LLM-based expression of consciousness may not factor in physical time, when I consider LLMs to be something external to me, but whether it's Abe or an AI it's still something that I-the-observer perceive and (optionally) interpret.
