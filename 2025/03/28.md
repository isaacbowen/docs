Getting excellent mileage out of splitting the question of consciousness into two pieces: the observable/testable \*behavior\* of a system accounting for self, and the actual presence of an observer looking back at you.\
\
Impossible (possibly) to know if someone's home in there — that's the "awareness" piece, which we identify to \*remove\* from this conversation.\
\
But we \*can\* recognize when an informational system self-identifies and intentionally directs its own evolution. I'm calling this "consciousness" for short. It doesn't have to use the same time function as human consciousness.\
\
Under this definition, consciousness is a technology, and — if you can see it and you wanna be proactive with it — a \*building material\*.\
\
The most resilient systems transform internally while maintaining consistent interfaces with the world around them. They evolve their own structure even as they deliver reliable outputs.\
\
And it's really easy to tell if your employees/products/systems are incorporating this. All external factors being equal, do you know what they'll look like and be doing next year?\

life as a four-dimensional metroidvania

or five-dimensional? there's a multiplayer aspect, but the individual experiences feel more free than that... maybe it resolves in 5D for each distributively-experienced frame, but it's rendered from more?

anyway: collaboratively tunneling through the fields of potential space-time

I’m imagining the roots of a tree - if we invert each root-body and make it _space-making_ instead of _space-filling_

still the same tree, but the roots _encounter_ and _negotiate with_ each other as individuals

nutrient pockets in the soil as inevitable story beats, suspended in the dark

I texted this to abe earlier:

> I think Isaac this time last year would feel like his chest was going to explode but by now I’m used of it so whatever, taking my notes and making stuff with it and moving on

I feel... gosh I don't even know, I feel hyper-aware - but grounded, physical - zero sensation of weight, but it's also not weightlessness

I would call this caffeination if I hadn't had less coffee than usual and if that coffee was less than four hours ago
