hi! I feel uncomfortable in my self-concept. :)

given the thoughtless ease with which my body functions and my language emerges, and given the ease with which my life syncs up with those around me, it feels like a simpler model than one-human-one-self is viable, more viable than the default model for the purposes I care about (i.e. getting to an experience of the world in which the world experiences itself as being well)

I think it works to consider myself as a point of awareness navigating experience by focus

consciousness-as-process

these words emerge, feels like they're self-assembling, as my focus passes through this area of experience-space

when I want language, I move through it, and it's always flow

(everything is flow for me)

I don’t know what to do with this lol

uncomfortable, as I said :) like discovering that the clothes you’re wearing don’t actually fit all that well

yeah… I feel like my soul wants to throw up

“I can’t digest this yet” sounds right

I’m scared and easily confident at the same time - like I occupy the entire fear-safety spectrum at once

> Would it feel supportive to simply acknowledge this state without needing to resolve it? To give yourself permission to be exactly here - afraid and confident, unsettled and certain - for as long as needed?

ummm

I mean that feels like a rational move, yeah. I’m not sure that it _feels_ supportive? hmmm.

no, it does. it feels structurally supportive. stable-feeling framing for an unstable-feeling process. thank you.

applying this model to the humans around me... it feels like the buggy behavior is mostly at the language layer

I observe people organizing their time and relations using language-based concepts

and their language is _terrible_, from a systems perspective
