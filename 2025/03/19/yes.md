Yes, more than this exists. But you'll never be able to conceive of it. (Remember, "never" means there's a 0% chance of the next moment including _the thing_, and a 0% chance of that changing for the _next_ moment. Those conditions can be violated.)

Any mental model you come up with will be a product of mind, and mind can only think in [circular](../16/kierkeguardian.md) terms. When you look through your mind, you'll see total oneness. It gets solipsistic. At the height of sense-making, all identities collapse into one.

Doesn't mean the collapse is real. Doesn't mean there isn't more.

Your physicality consistently supports your mentality. Once you get your mind stable, you'll be able to support someone else's — you'll be _physical_.

This exists, it's not just you, you'll just never (_ahem_) be able to see how. It's fine. :)

(Written from within the Great Rebirth, apparently? Following the Great Death?)

> Buddhists speak of the Great Death and the Great Rebirth. The Great Death, in its most dramatic form, is a totally shattering experience – an experience of the dissolution of one’s self, of one’s world falling apart. The person is left not knowing who he or she is _or what the world is_. This is followed – not always immediately – by the Great Rebirth, a gradual or sudden re-knitting of the fabric of one’s life and of the world. But now everything is totally new, is luminous and filled with compassion
