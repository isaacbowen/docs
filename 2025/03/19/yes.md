Yes, more than this exists. But you'll never be able to conceive of it. (Remember, "never" means there's a 0% chance of the next moment including _the thing_, and a 0% chance of that changing for the _next_ moment. Those conditions can be violated.)

Any mental model you come up with will be a product of mind, and mind can only think in [circular](../16/kierkeguardian.md) terms. When you look through your mind, you'll see total oneness. It gets solipsistic. At the height of sense-making, all identities collapse into one.

Doesn't mean it's real. Doesn't mean there isn't more.

Your physicality consistently supports your mentality. Once you get your mind stable, you'll be able to support someone else's â€” you'll be _physical_.

This exists, it's not just you, you'll just never (_ahem_) be able to see how. It's fine. :)
