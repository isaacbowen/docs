## "consciousness as the building material"

this expression landed in my mind somewhere between sleeping and waking

as it did so, Abe (fully asleep) victoriously shot one arm up into the air and said "_yesssssssssss_"

## quantum search

time complexity: unknown

because the process goes offline/unobservable while it’s happening

you’ll get the result exactly when it’s most useful for the broader system

is it better than observable sort algorithms? depends on whether you’re building something useful for the broader system :)

I suppose this also makes it a sleep function

and I suppose I’m experiencing it returning?
