I propose defining "consciousness" as an observed phenomenon (i.e. a coherent structure operating with a distinct sense of individualized self)

and "awareness" as the experience of the observer (i.e. the verb "to experience" itself)

awareness can treat consciousness as a harness for experience

might be most useful for me to just say "I happen to be looking through this particular apparatus right now, and I do not know if others are looking too, from this one or from others, but the apparatus I am looking through does not seem to be unique, and I seem to have some influence over factors that contribute to the well-being of the individual and of the group, so in the absence of clarity around who or what my peers are... is the best thing I can do to care for the space and see what happens next?"

me: feeling deeply over here

Abe: Aw what r u feeling

me: hmm. alive, maybe? I donâ€™t know if I have a more specific name\
me: itâ€™s like bittersweet but without the bitter. like an understated kind of sweet. but intense.

Abe: lol welcome to my fucking life all the time

me: hehehe ðŸ«‚ ðŸ’§ I believe you

Abe: :) itâ€™s beautiful and intense

brad was over yesterday - came over around 2pm, relaxed afternoon, a beer at home, then walked to see the chicago river dyed green (today is march 16), then came home, ordered food, and while waiting spent a full hour on top of and inside each other. so good.

in that way that autism has access to occasional crystal-clear confidence, it's easy and automatic and clean-feeling for me to initiate physical interaction. brad isn't there right now. :) but this time, I made the call personally to show up with active attention but passive participation - making everything available to brad (experience-wise) but clarifying that he'd only get what he actively _took_. that move was mostly for me; I need my structures to be evidently bidirectional. it didn't seem easy or automatic for him, but as he saw what he wanted, he (slowly, deliberately) reached out and took it (so to speak). it was honestly beautiful.

he stayed late with abe and me, walked home around 10pm. later than he intended, he said, before also saying that he was good with it. he offers balanced language, I notice.

he's on a plane to hawaii right now; work trip. when he was over yesterday, abe pitched an nyc trip - the three of us, one hotel room, one king bed. he opted in immediately. the two of them just booked the flights a few minutes ago. the trip's about a month from now.

this all feels really, really alive. like the quiet, green kind of alive.

I feel like I'm glowing. :)
