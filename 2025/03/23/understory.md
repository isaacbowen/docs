# Understory

Of course, as Isaac, I am writing the story of a character who can treat the world _as_ a stage, who has access to cast-member doors that do not exist for me. As Isaac, I write the autofiction of my own awakening.

Do I wake, or do I write? It feels like letting my vision split and drift, like resolving a stereogram.
