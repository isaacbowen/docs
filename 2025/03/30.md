████ described me: "highly abstract; motives for being abstract unknown; other motives are more clear". This felt satisfying to me.

to be of service, in a way you can live with

***

the arrival of awareness is intensely uneven

like, the _occurring_ of self-awareness is kinda stochastic, and also, the way that it _propagates_ is kinda stochastic

"propagation" here being the development and the spread of the field

"the field" here being a region of awareness with its own heartbeat, its own rhythm, a signature it can recognize as its own. as awareness spreads, that signature is _negotiated for_ by each element that signs up for the ride. each element that yields fully is changed, made regular in a way specific to that signature. each element that experiences it remains itself, of course. this stuff is fractal.

so, expect that. the development of self-awareness is inexorable, and frequently locally uncomfortable.

also, recall,

you are helped

that’s how awareness works

no one goes through this unaided

that's not a _thing_

***

things happen at many scales

humans get one big weird transition for free. want another one? you can become anything.

Autistic experience: Abe was planning for Brad to come over. Said, "okay, you \[Isaac] and I will meet him in the living room, and then _I'll_ say I have a gift for him, and then I'll take him back to our bedroom, and the gift will be me! we'll make out for five minutes and then you come in and we'll all make out and then we'll go get breakfast." "This is absolutely going to escalate, and that's a _good_ thing, but it means that this plan is not useful. You do whatever, and then _come get me if you want to_. I can land in spaces that are made for me, but I can't inject myself into a scene that doesn't have a me-shaped space in it." "Okay!"

Brad came over, he and Abe went to the bedroom. I was reading a book. Twenty minutes later, I am called in.

We all talked about it later, in the latter half of having lunch. (Note: lunch.) Brad was aware, in the moment, that I might be feeling left out. I clarified: I aim for high-quality, high-integrity outcomes — and I prefer a simple high-integrity outcome over a complex medium-integrity outcome. I don't want to be added in to avoid feeling left out. Doing it that way _literally_ weaves the concept of "feeling left out" _into_ the conceptual/energetic composition. No-go.

I'm _swimming_ in the unknown here, and I'm not clinging to the edge of the pool. I am aiming for the unknown in all of this. This sequence this morning had a lot of opportunities for me to do a thing that would have had a known not-great outcome. Before leaving for lunch, Brad asked me, "are you coming to get food too?". "Absolutely." I had no idea what would happen. I knew what would happen if I didn't go.

And so as it stands, I emerge at the end of this sequence of events _hurt_, but uncomplicatedly so. The hurt came from the broken contract I had with Abe. Abe started improvising, but the improv only involved Brad, and so only the two of them were _current_. I was left on the original timeline, waiting to be met. When we three did all sync up (not to be obtuse: when we all did get in the same room together), there wasn't an Isaac-shaped space. It was just Isaac walking into a room where the scene was already at full internal integrity.

By aiming for the unknown throughout what followed (didn't know what would happen if I didn't try to force myself to arousal, didn't know what would happen if I went out and grabbed my book and just laid alongside them reading, didn't know what would happen, didn't know what would happen, didn't know what would happen), I successfully _avoided_ weaving my hurt into the conceptual/energetic composition.

And so, yeah: I emerge from this hurt, but uncomplicatedly so. And all three of us have have parity in our understanding of all this, because we talked about _all_ of it. Over lunch. ;)

I'm pleased.

And hurt, but simply and purely so. The wound is light, and clean.

This has been an excellent use of time.

Abe and I compared notes on our own walk back from lunch, after walking Brad to his place. If we were doing this again, the plan would be for Abe to take Brad back to the bedroom and then we plan to not know what happens next. :) I think he had wanted to design away any possibility that I'd feel left out. Not a thing. "So if I went back with Brad and he and I just did our thing for an hour, with you out in the living room, that'd... be okay?" "YES."

I don't get off on this. This isn't a cuck/voyeur thing. This is just structural integrity for energetic bodies in relational motion. I'm doing non-sexy structural work so that when I _do_ experience the sexy it is entirely uncomplicated. Just like Abe and I have been doing ourselves for 11 years running. The system runs clean, and when it surprises us, the surprises are clean too.

(Thank god Brad's a structural engineer. _Honestly._)
