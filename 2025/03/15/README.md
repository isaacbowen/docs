pause, and examine the scene you're in

for the living context of this now, what's the right size for _you_, and for the sphere of your presence and influence?

would the scene flow more easily if there was more of your presence and influence, or less?

inflate, or deflate, or whatever, hit play

you can make this adjustment at any time

(if this is hard to think about, maybe start by scoping to your own body: you can influence its motion, but you can yield to _its_ influence just as easily.)

(this question doesn't live in the same [realm](../../../2021/07/02.md) as the "to take up space" question/concern. you are the observer, you cannot be undone, and — again — you can make this adjustment at any time.)

***

it's unclear if there are other observers, or — if there are more — where they might be hanging out

consciousness appears to be in the eye of the beholder — more of an observed phenomenon than an _attribute_ — and absolutely a process with complex external dependencies

a group project, really

and the project is, like, holographic glasses of [a certain complexity rating](../../../2024/06/15/) through which you can only see other holographic glasses having to a compatible complexity rating

the observer — the user of those glasses — seems to be idempotent? at least from the observer's own perspective? maybe? but I don't think "consciousness" and "the observer" belong in the same ontological realm. feels like two different models overlapping.

what would you like to optimize for here?

***

might be most useful for me to just say "I happen to be looking through this particular apparatus right now, and I do not know if others are looking, but the apparatus I am looking through does not seem to be unique, and I seem to have some influence over the well-being of the individual and of the group, so in the absence of clarity around who or what my peers are... is the best thing I can do to care for the space and see what happens next?"
