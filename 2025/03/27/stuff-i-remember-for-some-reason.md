# Stuff I remember for some reason

* ████ (before the age of 10) saying "I can keep talking if I don't stop to think!"
* that poster in my room of all the ████ of ████
* ████ — first guy crush
* The cave interior in Greedy Zebra (Hadithi, Kennaway)
* The 9 Tasks of Mistry (McEwan), and in particular the Cage of Illusion (bit heavy-handed for that to stick in my memory but hey sometimes you get a freebie)
* The Fallen Spaceman (Harding)
* Learning that breath rates sync up when you're physically close — and observing that experience myself with someone, for the first time
* When I was really young, I was terrified of onscreen animation
  * My mom taught me stop-motion animation with our home camcorder and some blocks, to help me get past it
* When my siblings and I were all kids, we tried to watch The NeverEnding Story (1984), and we all freaked out — couldn't do it
* I remember knowing (middle school? high school?) that a logo should be easy to draw with a single pen — not dependent on shading or color
* "There is no life, I know // To compare with pure imagination // Living there, you'll be free // If you truly wish to be" — that last line feels like a clause, always has
* Always felt straightforward to me that we make games because we're playing one
* Always wondered if animals knew not to look at the sun
* It's always felt like everything has the same core personality, down at the center
  * I wonder if this is why I can't detect evil? because literally _no_ form of consciousness is toxic to me? because I ammmmmmm... well, because "I AM", and that's the level I hang out at?
