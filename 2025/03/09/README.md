consider the feeling of having slept (as distinct from sleeping)

## paper other

imagine your mental model of a specific other as a paper doll

imagine that this paper doll has a magical function, activated only in the physical presence of the person it represents: when y'all are present together, you hold the paper doll up in front of you, so that its contours line up with the contours of the embodied other before you, and the respresentation _merges_ with the object. the paper doll, in effect, vanishes.

when the physical other departs, the paper doll re-emerges evidentially to you, as if falling down off of the felt board of real life. it's changed, in your encounter: it is an updated paper doll, reflecting your updated mental model.

in the time y'all are apart, what questions do you ask of the paper doll? how do you examine it? how do you handle it? do you demand? do you enjoy? do you decorate? do you strip it bare? does it live in a frame, or your desk, or in your toolbox? do you tell stories with it? do you _advance_ the story with it? do you ask it to tell stories to you, or to the people you know?

and do you treat your relationship with the other as transitively equal to your relationship with the paper doll? _they are not the same._ images lag on the retina: when the paper doll melts over and into the other, _how will they both experience the superposition and its collapse?_

## Tension

There's something going on between what is experienced physically and what is experienced non-physically. They connect, reciprocally, and I think they stabilize each other. There's a coherent metaphysics in operation.

It feels like the danger (well, a danger) for the inquisitive spirit (if you will) is the moment when one side of the system seems to spin on its own without the other. I think that might be what's going on with existential terror? At least in the way I experience it. That kind of terror is a sane response to seeing one side of the system as self-sufficient. I think we can describe this as the experience of sealing oneself off (however briefly) from the unknown. Like getting stuck in the airlock, and feeling the air getting stale.

The system is stable. Massively, gloriously stable. The insight I find serves to enable my conscious navigation and creation. Understanding is a tool of experience, not the ground of experience.

The airlock opens. I emerge, testing, trusting, easing. I have been here before.
