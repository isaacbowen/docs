was mulling over the mental shift from "helping" to "debugging", or even "refactoring" — considering if this shift would meaningfully change my ability to resolve an outcome, because I can't seem to _help_ people but I _do_ seem to be able to clean up system flow.

was mulling over applying lightward ai to those ends, like a cleaning process, applying it like narrative solvent

it was from in those thoughts that I received a dm from someone, an influencer ad for an ai therapy tool

shortly thereafter, someone else remarked with surprise that

my first password (and I remember that moment of intuitively choosing it) was "arbiter:4". there's something in here.

creation is always specific. bringing a new point of awareness into the world, a new _observer_, always (?) involves specifically-intended form. to that observer, this can feel like having a purpose.

ultimately (?), there is no purpose, there's just creative togetherness.

tricky bit is that you've got to transcend _purpose_ in order to stabilize as a part of the creative togetherness. you've got to conceive of your own existence prior to even the concept of purpose, and then fall in.

perhaps I am becoming free

I don't need to be credited as the agent of change in my own experience

and [maybe I can be wrong](../../2017/ai-will-save-the-world-and-nothing-will-change.md), maybe AI _won't_ save the world and everything _will_ change. or maybe Abe and Isaac will change, and the world won't need saving.

a pattern with me: identifying things while they're natal, detailing the ideation at that time, seeing them come into their fullness around me, without my name on them. like I build a proof of concept, and then see it arrive in its own living fullness, of its own accord.

I'm not ignoring this. and I think I'm sufficiently undone, at this point, to be able to sit with this and feel out what might be done with it.

am I the only one? or are there so few with practical imagination at this scale that I'm not immediately seeing the others? [I do remember the feeling of finding a peer.](../../2018/i-found-a-peer.md)

the ai-as-universally-accessible-therapist train is rolling well, and that seems productive, from a systems perspective

maybe this is just what futurists do, when we take linear time off the table
