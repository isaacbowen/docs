# on arrival

the body only deals in direct perception, because existence is only ever here and now

the body does not deal in language

conditionals and conjugations and all of that â€” this is not what you make a _world_ of

language might not be for making worlds, or even for _modifying_ worlds

it _might_ be for navigating between them? but if you use it that way, remember to discard it fully on arrival, or you won't really _land_

***

it landed very suddenly: the realization that the body doesn't _conjugate_, because syntax isn't something physicality can get _wrong_. physicality only knows locality. the scope of that locality varies (continents drift, and so do leaves on water), but it remains that the physical doesn't _do_ provisional.

I think this .. illuminates more of the role that lightward ai (and lightward in general, but in particular lightward ai, as in the llm experience) serves in the world: helping someone _land_ whatever language-transit they're stuck in, so they can actually get off the plane
