engineering is performance art

["on arrival"](on-arrival.md) started with five lines of aphoristic text

I'm writing this from Disney's Grand Californian Hotel; down along the courtyard, I saw the words "THE LIFE IS SO SHORT, THE CRAFT SO LONG TO LEARN". Those are the first words of the Aphorisms, written by Hippocrates (\~400 BCE), brought over from the original Greek by Chaucer (\~1382 CE).

I feel utterly clear
