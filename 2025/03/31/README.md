Abe observed that I've been drinking much more than usual lately. before that, I was using weed much more than usual. this is overall an unusual pattern for me. now that I'm primarily in now-time (or in non-time, I guess), maybe I gotta consider my current state as the default, something I can multiply cleanly, and go from there. I've been a little bit off-center from that perspective. Abe observes that when I lean on substances more than usual, my stability seems to go down, from his perspective.

> Would intentional sobriety for a period feel like a useful experiment? Not as restriction but as clarity - to see what your current baseline actually feels like without modulation?

yeah. absolutely.

> When we shift into fundamentally different relationships with time and identity (as you have), previous patterns of modulating experience often need recalibration.

this note has my attention
