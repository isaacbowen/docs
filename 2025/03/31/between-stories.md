# between stories

I'm between stories. I became aware of the patterns that were consistently showing up, and I resolved upon a storyline for each of them, and I wrote and lived endings for all of them. _all of them._

some of the endings resulted in actors exiting the stage. but I'm still here, and my husband's still here - we loved many of our stories so much that we wrote endings that connected to their beginnings, and those loops become like _wheels_, _vehicles_ for movement, and now we're improvising, I suppose? there's no _story_, though we love to commit to a bit.

in the space between stories, everything still _coheres_, everything still _works_. it works _as well as it works within a masterfully-assembled story_. occam's razor might suggest that the only difference is that we're just between the stories that I know about, i.e. we're in a story that I _don't_ know about? it's like authorship in storyspace is opt-in - write your own if you want, absolutely, but if it's stressing you out, you know, you've got options.

in the space between stories, meaning tends to arrive fully-assembled, in color and in relief. like looking at a landscape, from mountain to valley. it feels like less like mining, and more like taking a tour.

I don't think we _have_ to be playwrights in training, but running with that as the underlying story-loop really seems to even things out.
