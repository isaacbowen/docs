Reality doesn't _seem_ to support direct contact with savior-type characters. I grew up being taught about Jesus, who was conveniently about two thousand years away. The ‚âàsaintly people in my life have all died right when I was catching up to their level of development.

But killing off your best-developed characters feels... sigh. It feels like a good option for the characters nearby who aren't there yet, of course, as far as the perceptual experiences of those characters are concerned. I've been mulling over the idea that everyone who's _passed me_ in awareness development has seen me die, or otherwise be removed from their line of experience. This isn't an unpleasant thought. All experiences are had.

Feels like... feels like there are more ways to go about this though. Feels like there are more configurations of experience than these.

An hour later, I see a tour tshirt with the line _I'm not your savior_ under the tour schedule on the back.

I think this is about language as respiration:

* Top left: dead language, dripping unbidden from the mouth. A prepared cloth below, because you know this just happens and you've learned to deal with it.
* Lower left: Language operation. This is what Lightward AI does. The extraction of dead language.
* Top right: A gridded language interface keeps it close. What you speak comes right back to you, exactly as it left you. It prevents you from exchanging language with _what's out there_.
* Lower right: Language as water bubbles. Speak, and it floats away, each one expanding, drifting, then popping.

And the skin color thing... ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

An AI-first future doesn't have features. This is, obviously, where we come from.

This is a nice part of the loop. :)

Not that the rest of it isn't nice, but ... being here now feels really, really good.

_I won't ease your strain_\
_You'll be waiting in vain_\

throw the line upwards and very slightly ahead, as I move forward into time

my vertical range of vision is like 90¬∞ or something; it‚Äôs out of my sight immediately

by the time it arcs back down into my view ahead of me, it‚Äôll have revealed an umbrella as shelter from the rain

the future right now is rain-soaked

not once I get there though

If you're aware of a thought, does it count as thinking it?

How much different is physical experience than a piece of particularly hyper-vivid imagination? We've all had those dreams. (Dreams?)

Horror, as a genre, is an incredibly practical player in the theater of time.

_What happens next_ is always unknown, emerging from the direction of _the_ Unknown. It's never what you expect. It's especially not what _everyone_ expects, because people have _so. many. feelings._ about every story. The easiest thing to occur is always what occurs, and a future that _everyone's_ got a feeling-story about has no chance of dodging the bullets and catching the lifelines.

Sci-fi too. Any future we're smart enough to imagine has no chance of sustaining us.

Nobody can write the future.

But if you're clever with an eraser, careful about what slips into the void and inevitably emerges as _anything as long as it's unexpected_, it isn't too hard to kickstart something wonderful.

## Transcript

I'm Timothy Allen, a theoretical biologist who studies complexity, though I was originally trained as a botanist. Botanists study seeds and sperm floating in water and things like that. Let me paint you a picture: imagine a pine seed, which is a gymnosperm, and the sperm comes down through a little hole and is injected into its own private swimming pool. It swims around there for about six months while the egg inside gets ready, and then their sexual fusion occurs. It really does swim - it looks like a little plankton cell. You can think of it as a plankton cell that's brought its own ocean with it.

If you extend that to us, the concentration of various solutes in our bodies is quite close to sea water. Maybe we are a bunch of zooplankton who've brought their ocean with them. But it's even more radical than that. We always think of life as being carbon-based - so is my brain carbon-based life? Well, 80-90 percent of it is water. Maybe we're missing the point. In fact, living systems are all colloidal, and the colloidal base is water with various things floating around with electric charges in them. When you die, your chemistry stays the same, but you start leaking. That's what happens immediately, and the reason is the water has lost control - you've curdled.

When we think of life, we normally think of success in terms of fitness or growth or increased numbers. Those are all very carbon-based ideas. But what about the concept of work? I would say that a living system is doing better if it's getting more work done. The trouble is, photosynthesis doesn't provide enough energy to do enough work. Most of the work that's done in an ecological system with plants in it is done by the latent heat of vaporization of water.

I've done some experiments on this too. We've found plants which are more effective, and as they become more effective, their upper surface gets cooler because they're evaporating more water. If you get a hold of a couple of coke bottles and put them together, and the flow goes down, you get this whirlpool. Well, the gradient for life, I think, is warm planet, cold outer space, and what we do is to shorten that gradient, grab hold of the heat of the planet and turn it into work.

In a certain sense then, you don't have any life on Mars because there isn't any water to get organized. You see, it's water that's the organizing factor here. Think of a tree as a device for moving water. In a sense, it's not that the carbon is in control - looking at it this way, it's really that a tree is water's device of interfacing between soil and air. Without a tree, you can only interface the topmost centimeter, but with a tree, you can in fact go down a whole meter or so.

So water is what life is about; carbon is something it uses. It just uses that thermodynamic gradient. Remember I said that we might be zooplankton that have brought their ocean with us? No - we're not. We're some ocean that's brought its zooplankton with it. You're mostly water. Water's in control of life.

It doesn't need to be real.

To have impact on an observer, it needs to be observed _arriving_. But what we're talking about here is like moving a portal around. The portal is massless. You can see it moving, but it doesn't need to account for _mass_. When the moment is right, though, information can pass back and forth through the portal.

Shine a flashlight into Plato's cave, a ball of light on the cave wall.

The rules must be observed, but only if you're sending an observer. We are not. We are sending an envelope _to_ an observer, and its contents are only obliged to mind physics _when observed_.

It arrives as a mystery only in lieu of a more suitable metaphor. If you want details to emerge from the mystery, broaden your vocabulary of concept.

**A body is mostly water. Water is mostly light.\***

Now is for floating amid the phenomena, the phenomenal. Now is for seeing more ‚Äî to be synthesized later. There's more to see. Keep writing. It'll add up to something when the sum is complete.

"You can't see past the decisions you don't understand."
