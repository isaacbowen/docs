2005-11-03 21:14:00,Moving on,"<p>Gave in (to&#8230; myself?), bought a domain, and installed Textpattern. [ laughs ] This must be&#8230; what, the fourth site that I&#8217;ve had? But I can probably stick with this one for a while. Hopefully, anyway.</p>

<p>Anyhoo, enjoy the site. There isn&#8217;t a whole lot here, as the site&#8217;s only been in existence for about two hours (-ish), but give me time and things&#8217;ll start showing up.</p>

<p>Also semi-related to moving on: the first term of the year is <em>over</em>. This is a very good thing. :) ... Yeah. It&#8217;s just <em>really</em> good to be done with this last set of classes. Advanced Modern Lit was interesting (a bit painful, actually, but interesting), and Physics was&#8230; alright, whatever, so the term wasn&#8217;t actually that bad. But I am glad that it&#8217;s over with. Next term brings a study hall that I plan to fill with courses taken online through NTC for college &#38; hs credit, which should be cool. $99/credit, which isn&#8217;t bad at all when one considers that there&#8217;s no other tuition fees. [ shrugs ]</p>

<p>In any case, it&#8217;s nice to move on. Got a fresh start here on a website, starting a fresh term on Monday. Take a deep breath. Now go.</p>

2005-11-04 03:37:00,[ yawn ],"<p>3:45 and off to Northwestern College in Minneapolis. Or Roseville, or something like that.We have today off from school (end of term and all), so I (well, my parents and <em>then</em> I) figured that I might as well spend it doing something productive, like traveling to Minnesota to visit a college or something. &#8220;Or something&#8221; being Nathan M, so it&#8217;s more like &#8220;to visit a college and something&#8221;. Yeah.</p>

<p>So just before I fell asleep last night (and, by the way, one wakes up a lot more easily to an alarm clock if there&#8217;s already classical music playing), I remembered something that I should bring, so I stick a post-it note (generic brand; they&#8217;re cheaper and just as good, and yes, I keep post-it notes at my bed-side) on the back of my alarm clock and turned it (the clock) around backwards so I&#8217;d <em>remember</em> whatever it was I was supposed to. So now, it&#8217;s 3:30 and I&#8217;m remembering that there&#8217;s&#8230; something that I&#8217;ve forgotten, dang it.</p>


",exigraff wp_posts.csv
2005-11-04 13:17:55,At Northwestern,"<p>It&#8217;s&#8230; noonish, and it seems that the time thinger on this site is one hour off. [ adds to to-do list ]</p>

<p>I&#8217;m in Nathan&#8217;s dorm at NWC, working&#8230; on my blog? Nathan doesn&#8217;t have Intro to Music today (but he informs me that he has a test on Monday and that I should help him study).</p>

<p>Mom &#38; I got here around 9:00 this morning (our discussion whilst we traveled was more or less coherent, considering the ungodly hour). Went to Music Theory, which was interesting and informative. Definitely something that I need to get into a <em>lot</em> more (should have done it years ago). Chapel (in Maranatha Hall, not the actual chapel) followed, which was kinda cool. This trio of rappers rapped several times over with stuff that I <em>think</em> was original, actually. The guy in the middle mostly just stood there and nodded his head, and when he did sing (talk? verbalize?), his face turned red. But don&#8217;t get me wrong, they weren&#8217;t bad. I just don&#8217;t really like rap.</p>

<p>Nathan then gave me a general tour of the campus, which is growing on me. I was a bit turned off by the oldness of a few of the buildings (and, in my opinion, concrete block should be covered by something more than white paint when considering classroom walls), but it&#8217;s cool.</p>

<p>So&#8230; we don&#8217;t really have anything to do until 12:35, which is lunch (which we will be meeting Alison M. for), and then until 2:00. We&#8217;ll figure out something, likely.</p>

<p>And this touchpad is really beginning to get on my nerves. I&#8217;m using Nathan&#8217;s laptop, and I keep hitting the pad while I type. Gah.</p>


",exigraff wp_posts.csv
2005-11-04 20:33:00,The Car from Hell,"<p>So Nathan invites Ben M over for&#8230; something or other, swimming I think. We ran over to the Ericson Center (Nathan refused to tell me why) by way of Purgatory and then proceeded into the Hell adjascent to the Center.</p>

<p>Just so your perception of me isn&#8217;t entirely shattered, Hell &#38; Purgatory are both parking areas. Nobody really knows why.</p>

<p>But anyway, we get to <del>Hell</del> the parking lot and look for a tan car with two doors. Nathan, again, wouldn&#8217;t tell me why. We found the car, and then searched it for keys. I kept expecting some security guy to come up to us and politely ask what we were doing, but such fears were unfounded.</p>

<p>We found the keys and went into the Ericson Center to look for a phone (there are phones <em>all</em> over the campus. like everywhere.) by means of which to call Ben M, who, apparently, Nathan had invited over for the evening. <em>Now</em> that I know what&#8217;s going on, Nathan asks me if I can drive stick (that tan car is a manual) in order to go pick up Ben at wherever he was (somewhere in central Saint Paul). Ha. I&#8217;ve driven a stick shift&#8230; twice, I think?</p>

<p>So we go back to the car to practice (Nathan wanted me to teach him), but none of the keys worked. The car didn&#8217;t yield any other sets of keys (but did contain some old Chinese food, a rotten apple and a container of some unknown substance under the seat), and Ben had no idea where any other keys might be (his brother&#8217;s card, evidently). So, Ben goes, &#8220;Well, my <em>room-mate</em> can probably give me a ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>Problem solved. And now I find out that the food court closes the grill at 7. Gah.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Ben just walked in. <em>Guess</em> who had the real keys.</p>

2005-11-05 21:42:27,Back home,"<p>Woke up to the initial alarm this morning at 8:30, and went back to sleep. <em>Got</em> up to my mom&#8217;s phone message left at 9:30, saying that she&#8217;d be over in 20 minutes to pick me up, which I found mildly odd, since she had said earlier that she&#8217;d pick me up <em>at</em> 9:30. I probably would have found it more so had I gotten more sleep, but it doesn&#8217;t really matter.</p>

<p>Neither of the dorm-folk were really awake when I left, but Nathan was sufficiently conscious to groggily shake my hand prior to my departure. Love that guy.</p>

<p>So&#8230; Mom and I went shopping at a nearby mall which wasn&#8217;t enormous, but it was of fair size. Nice and clean. Had breakfast, which consisted of an Italian sub (they didn&#8217;t have the spice &#38; herb bread, but wheat worked) and a cold caramel something-or-other from Caribou. Good pick-me-up.</p>

<p>Browsed through a few stores, including the Apple store (you know that you&#8217;re going to be enormously successful for at least the next decade if you only have to place your logo on the storefront and people pack the location at 10:00 am) and a air-toy store (kites, little fun flying things, potato guns, etc).</p>

<p>Looked through Lands&#8217; End for an hour or so where I found two shirts that fit me perfectly. You have <em>no</em> idea how happy that made me.</p>

<p>I think we had lunch at Wendy&#8217;s before we made the trek home. I slept for a while in the car, which is rare and indicative how tired I was. [ grins ] Which is strange, because I did get in a good seven hours of sleep&#8230; ah well.</p>

<p>Piano instruction went well. <em>Really</em> well. And I didn&#8217;t even learn much.

2005-11-13 19:02:28,Hazards in Travel,"<p>So. I left PGCC at about 12:40 for the Saint Germain Evangelical Free Church where the music recital was to be held, armed with a map courtesy of Google Local. After turning off 17 onto 70, I traveled the 2.8 miles prescribed and found absolutely no church. I went on for another mile or so, then retraced my steps (steps?) until I reached 17 again. Definitely no church there. At that point, I happened to check my gas meter (and a good thing, too), and realized that I had better stop at a gas station before I went out church-seeking any further. I stopped in Eagle River (closest to where I was) at a Marathon (where I came <em>this</em> close to putting deisel in the tank). ... They <em>really</em> need to label the displays on the fill islands more clearly. I ended up watching the &#8220;gas pumped&#8221; display instead of the &#8220;total price&#8221;, and when I realized my mistake, my tank had already been filled with $5.34 worth of gas. Which was good, I suppose, but I only had four dollars on me. The cashier inside was, more or less, understanding about it, and gave me an IOU.</p>

<p>Gah. I opted to then stop for directions, and stopped at a house that was right about where the church should have been. A woman came to the door a minute or two after I knocked, then called her husband over (as &#8220;he [knew] directions better&#8221;). I learned from them that the church was a good five minutes further on, past &#8220;a bar, a restaurant and a go-kart track&#8221;. This was going <em>way</em> off of the map that Google had delivered. But go there I did, and I did find the church (street number 6065 in the middle of the 7000s) in time for the latter two thirds of the recital (I was in the last half, fortunately).</p>

<p>Anyway, I afterwards grabbed a twenty from an ATM at a gas station in Saint Germain, then trekked back to the Marathon in Eagle River to pay back the $1.34 (where the cashier revealed that &#8221;[she] actually didn&#8217;t expect [me] to come back; [she was] impressed&#8221;).</p>

<p>I managed to find my way back home without any undue mishaps. The end.</p>

2005-11-22 23:52:20,Theories the First and Second,"<p>I just got off the phone from a lengthy conversation with aJ, and I have come out of it with a theory:</p>

<p>People who are depressed would rather stay depressed than anything else. Mostly because of the change involved in moving from depression to&#8230; anything else. There&#8217;s some kind of strange security in knowing where/how you are, and you&#8217;d almost rather stay in that state of mind than have to move your mindset over to something else.</p>

<p>In theory, anyway.</p>

<p>I also came up with this beauty, following some statement quietly spoken over the phone from the other end.</p>

<p>Situation: the person that you&#8217;re talking to speaks something softly, but not <em>too</em> quietly. You then intelligently respond, &#8220;huh?&#8221; They say &#8220;Nothing&#8230;&#8221; and then you answer whatever they had just said that you hadn&#8217;t appeared to hear.</p>

<p>What really happened: the person on the other end says that something just quietly enough so that you, on <em>your</em> end, would be able to hear it but get the impression that the other person hadn&#8217;t meant for you to hear it. Heaven knows why the other individual wanted that. You then, politely, query on what they had said. They push it to the side, intending for you to pursue the topic that they had already semi-indirectly established, knowing that you now know that there&#8217;s something that they want to say.</p>

<p>... Yeah.</p>

2005-11-24 20:11:51,Rhody Thanksgiving,"<p>Well, most of the Rhodys (Rhody&#8217;s? Rhodies?). A couple families couldn&#8217;t make it, one because a sister died and the other because&#8230; actually, I&#8217;m not sure.</p>

<p>But in any case, the dinner was excellent and the conversation was good. I&#8217;m enjoying being able to semi-relax a bit.</p>

<p>My mom made several quotable comments, the most notable of which are approximated below:</p>

<ol>
<li>&#8220;How much sugar would you like? Five forks or four?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Is that a <em>real</em> maple tree growing out of the Christmas cactus behind you?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;No, actually, it&#8217;s not over your head. It&#8217;s in front and to the left.&#8221; (this spoken when assuring Hannah that the topic being discussed was not &#8220;over her head&#8221;, but&#8230; never mind.)</li>
</ol>

<p>The Sarkinnen (I believe that&#8217;s spelled correctly) cousins showed up later on, having had their own Thanksgiving dinner with their various sub-branches of the family tree. An&#8230; <em>active</em> game of Spoons was played, and no one was seriously impaired as a result.</p>

However, there was this little hand-made sign on the door of the LGI saying something to the effect that there&#8217;s a two hour delay for the school district, so you&#8217;re two hours early. Gah.

2005-12-01 19:41:40,"Thursday, Dec. 1","<p>Several things to note:</p>

<p>1. During physics, Josh informed me quite somberly that he was glad that we are to start Rennaisance (sp?) literature in Early Eng. Lit., and that he &#8220;would push for a test&#8221; on this unit. This after we, as a class, opted not do do one on medieval lit. And this before he threw a wad of paper at Brandon. It was provoked. :D</p>

<p>2. Mrs. Chrisinger went through a bit of art this evening with the Decathlon team, and made the comment that tempera was &#8220;what you used in the day-care when you were little.&#8221; It struck me very strongly as a line that might have been from a book that Ray Bradbury might have written, about a world where the young were placed in day-cares while&#8230; while something, anyway. Very strange.</p>

<p>3. &#8220;A Christmas Carol&#8221; opened tonight. Mi familia is likely going to go tomorrow.</p>

<p>But meanwhile, Pastor Darrell&#8217;s email is still broken. Gah. And&#8230; I need to cut this off and get back to the post later; Mike&#8217;s about to start speaking again (the break for lunch just ended).</p>

<p>[ 2:03 pm ]<br />
Next break. He&#8217;s running about 10 minutes behind schedule, which might be partly because Mike put too much liver into a beaker full of&#8230;. of some kind of acid. The thing over flowed and <em>kept</em> overflowing. :) Very cool.</p>

<p>Anyway, Darrell&#8217;s email. A great guy, and he&#8217;s very nice about it, but it&#8217;s gotta be a bit frusterating when you&#8217;ve been trying to use your email for the last four days and it hasn&#8217;t been working.

2005-12-05 22:21:33,(Male+Female)^2,"<p>Had an interesting discussion with Calah, Beau and Matt over lunch this afternoon, partially regarding the various aspects of gender in American culture. Things like why no one looks twice at a girl wearing a tie and how people would react if a guy walked into school wearing a skirt and heels. (Personally, I think Avril Lavigne looks good with a tie, but I don&#8217;t think that proves any kind of point, so&#8230; whatever.)</p>

<p>And here&#8217;s an interesting thought: if a guy is gay, then he&#8217;s attracted to the male sex. That would give him a female-role in whatever relationship he might end up in, from his point of view, so it&#8217;s almost some kind of slightly twisted male-female relationship. Same thing conversely with lesbian females, right? So the only really homosexual relationship possible, assuming that a gay individual switches gender roles, would be between a gay guy and a lesbian female. But then, that&#8217;s really a straight relationship, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>... Yeah, that&#8217;s a little bit strange to think about, and probably something that you weren&#8217;t expecting to see in my blog. New things happen every day. Example: I found out today that Aaron Pierre likes trance music. Cool.</p>

<p>These are Goodwill skates mind you, and aren&#8217;t bad at all. The only thing is that the laces are <em>just</em> small enough to fit through the holes, provided that the little plastic caps on the ends of the laces don&#8217;t break off. And when they <em>do</em> break, you&#8217;re in for twenty minutes of meticulous lace-threading. And, if you have semi-large feet, you&#8217;ll have a bit of a difficult time jamming your feet into the skates cuz you really can&#8217;t make them any looser without unlacing the top few holes and you <em>really</em> don&#8217;t want to un-lace those after the work that went into lacing them in the first place.

<p>Got to school at 6:45-ish to drop Hannah off for Driver&#8217;s Ed and got to spend the next half an hour wandering the school and trying to make the time go faster by playing calculator games until the library opened. Which it did, and I was able to get a bit of work done on mi bloggo (adding the Milwaukee theme) and&#8230; something else. aJ stopped by and we exchanged polite conversation in which I expressed my desire for a black leather trenchcoat and Jake Ciela expressed his amusement at said desire.

<p>Show Choir performed for the morning and evening 6th grade concerts and again for the local Rotary group&#8217;s meeting. It is <em>really</em> quite cramped in the little mini-conference room in the basement of the Claridge (hotel). Wohlleber and I were struck by the facts that (1) &#8220;Christmas&#8221; had been censored from every non-song-title bit of the 6th grade concert program (replaced with &#8220;Holiday&#8221;) and that (2) so many of the names of the 6th graders sounded <em>dangerous</em>. <em>Furyk</em>, Biedrzyski, Schwarts, Nuszkiewicz, Metropulos (sounds Greek), <em>Crofoot</em>... What happened to Smith and Jones?</p>

<p>The (6th grade) band and chorus really didn&#8217;t do that badly. The band wasn&#8217;t all that great, actually, but for a bunch of 6th graders who have had their instruments for a grand total of three months, it wasn&#8217;t bad at all. The chorus was generally in unison, except for the parts where they weren&#8217;t. Harmony, I mean. It&#8217;s interesting; Carla (choir director) is pretty predictable in her selection of choral pieces. There&#8217;s usually one &#8220;clever&#8221; one (i.e. a play on another song or something), a &#8220;cute&#8221; one and a song that cuts you to the heart and makes you really contemplate your role in life. This year&#8217;s were entitled &#8220;O Christmas Tree&#8221; (&#8220;why are you needles falling?&#8221; &#8220;why are you always leaning?&#8221; &#8220;you are a fire hazard!&#8221;), &#8220;Gloves&#8221; and &#8220;The Christmas in <em>Me</em>&#8221; (emphasis mine), respectively.</p>

<p>One final event: Council officer meeting. We had pizza and talked about Council stuff, more or less. I was bestowed with the honor of ordering the pizza, and after inadvertently calling Home Medical Services was able to successfully place a delivery order (&#8220;And what kind of crust would you like on those?&#8221; &#8220;Oh! Cheese-stuffed!&#8221; &#8220;We don&#8217;t offer that.&#8221; &#8220;Well&#8230; what are the options?&#8221; &#8220;Thin-crust and hand-tossed/deep-dish.&#8221; &#8220;Um&#8230; one of each.&#8221; &#8220;So it doesn&#8217;t really matter?&#8221; &#8220;Nah. Do whatever you want; knock yourself out.&#8221; &#8221;(uncertain laugh)&#8221;). I brought up the Council website and what the heck should be done with it near the end and found myself a new member of the PR committee. I&#8217;m not really sure if I was transfered from Student Awareness or if I&#8217;m now on both&#8230;</p>

<p>The best part was one disabled boy in the Concert band. Blind, in a wheelchair. His helper-person (unsure of the title) sat next to him. He played the little jingle-bell thing, his helper-person telling him when to start and stop playing. Seeing him when he got to play was the coolest thing ever&#8230; The look on his face was pure joy, utter happiness. Wow. Don&#8217;t see that every day. It&#8217;s kind of bittersweet, reacting to his reaction and realizing that he&#8217;s only getting this because he&#8217;s&#8230; disabled. Ironic that those who have a sub-normal understanding of the world enjoy it more. Ignorance is bliss, I suppose. Wow.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, a friend of mine just found herself on one end of a bit of a relational crisis.

The Boar&#8217;s Head Carol was among the list, the history of which (included in the carol book) I&#8230; was <em>going</em> to place below, but the Sarkinnens took the book to drop off at the library on their way home.</p>

<p>Anyway, it is mentioned in said history that they carry out a boar&#8217;s head at an Oxfordian dinner every year.

2005-12-30 18:40:00,Bargo,"<p>Huzzah for the second new theme in&#8230; yeah, in two days. The last one (blue_orange, for those who knew it by that name) wasn&#8217;t that great. I like this, though.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bargo&#8221; is a mix of three different identifiers: &#8220;bar&#8221; for the bars of the header/footer, &#8220;g&#8221; for &#8220;green&#8221;, and &#8220;o&#8221; for &#8220;orange&#8221;. :) Okay, so not very clever, but vatevah.</p>

<p>In any case, I was going for a more &#8220;open&#8221; design; something that would allow for more expansion as needed. blue_orange was a bit restricting. The sidebar looked kinda cool, but wasn&#8217;t very flexible. <em>This</em> sidebar <em>is</em> more flexible (well&#8230; not really, actually), and I&#8217;ll add more content later.</p>

<img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/"" />

<p>Yeah. The thing was coded with 4 div&#8217;s for each larger box (one for each edge&#8217;s background), and with a single tag for each button (of a fixed size with a single background img). The boxes expanded vertically, but there was no really good way to make it work at all. Four div&#8217;s for anything is really too many.</p>

<p>Although, that could be fixed if CSS allowed for multiple background images, but I haven&#8217;t the faintest as to how that could be accomplished. &#8220;background1: url(...);&#8221;? Nah. There&#8217;s no really good way to do that, either. Might be cool, though.</p>

<p>On a slightly (but not extremely) unrelated note, I&#8217;m having a bit of trouble telling the article titles not to have that orange underline. If anyone has any ideas, let me know.

Thankfully, he turned on his phone before he put too much distance between himself and us; he left his insulin equipment behind. :) He&#8217;s a good guy. He came over to work on the barn with Dad, but we got some skiing and such in while he was here.</p>

<p>Aaron and I got his punching bag put up in the basement, next to the new-and-shiny weight machine. He&#8217;s not really sure how to use it (the punching bag; the weight thing came with an instructional poster with <em>pictures</em>), so he&#8217;s just slamming it around at the moment. I can feel it through the floor, but it sounds more like something hitting wood than a vinyl bag&#8230; hm.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s Eve. Nothing really special planned&#8230; we&#8217;ll probably watch a few movies or something. Mom just walked in and made note of the postcard leaning against my monitor with the phrase &#8220;Head-Smashed-In-Buffalo-Jump&#8221; (look &#8211; <a href=""http://head-smashed-in.com/"">there&#8217;s a website!</a>) written in watercolor beneath an inspiring image of over-scaled buffalo standing at the edge of a cliff. A momento of the rest of the family&#8217;s trip to Canada this summer while Hannah and I were gone, I believe. :) Abbey showed me an assortment of postcards that they had picked up and asked which I would prefer. Really, was there a choice to be made?</p>

<p>So&#8230; I&#8217;m working on my Macbeth essay for English. Yes, I did procrastinate for the entire week. Fortunately, we also have Monday off, so I&#8217;ll get a chance to work on my Shakespeare project (on which I also procrastinated) before vacation&#8217;s over.</p>

2006-01-02 01:30:04,White Rabbit,"<p>Mom woke me up initially with a cheery greeting of &#8220;White rabbit!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;White rabbit&#8221; is a tradition that came from <em>who</em> knows where. The goal is to be the first person to say &#8220;white rabbit&#8221; to everyone else on the first of the month. Personally, I wouldn&#8217;t mind winning a month or two, but (1) I&#8217;m a late sleeper and (2) my memory is prone to failure. Particularily on early Sunday mornings.</p>

<p>So anyway. Mom woke me up with a reminder that yes, I had indeed both overslept and forgotten our monthly ritual. So I fell <em>back</em> asleep, but managed to mutter something about how dastardly it really is to&#8230; something. Dad woke me up some time later (haven&#8217;t a clue when Mom came in) to inform me that I had half an hour to get up, get cleaned/dressed, eat and fill the woodstove before we left for church. Ee.</p>

<p>The time that mi familia spends at church is split into two halves with a bit of time in between. (So more like two sets of 1/5 splits with one 1/5 in the middle?) The first&#8230; half is spent in the Children&#8217;s Ministry. My mom heads that up and the rest of us are Shepherd Group leaders (excepting Abbey and Aaron, who are <em>in</em> Shepherd Groups). Between you and I, she&#8217;s done a phenomenal job with the program.</p>

<p>Anyhoo. Today being New Years and being the day where our regular lesson-teacher-person (there must be a real title&#8230;) wasn&#8217;t able to make it, we had a fun day. The other weeks are fun too, but this week was only for games and such. A selection of snapshots will follow, but I don&#8217;t have time to post them just now. [ adds to mental to-do list ]</p>

<p>Back at home, we lunched on leftover pizza (oh! I wrote a poem about leftover pizza &#8211; will have to post that later), brocholli-cheese soup (Mom&#8217;s soup is the best), and&#8230; other stuff. Casual lunch. Mom and Dad crashed afterwards and the rest of us watched a 321-Penguins video and The Lord of the Beans (&#8220;I am named for the sound that I make in my throat &#8211; ahem.&#8221;). Good stuff; the guys at Big Idea must have a lot of fun with these. Which reminds me (though it&#8217;s not really related): I need to watch Office Space before it&#8217;s due. Maybe tomorrow&#8230; We have Monday off of school as well, which is nice.</p>

<p>Sledding and other snow-based activity came next, but I really don&#8217;t feel like detailing it. Suffice it to say that the snow was cold, and I managed to dump an entire (well, mostly entire) shovel-full of snow down my neck without <em>any</em> help whatsoever. :)</p>

2006-01-04 15:51:28,untitled,"<p>Okay, so it only takes 5 extra minutes to get from home to school when the car at the front of the other 8 cars is going 35 mph. But still.</p>

<p>Mom and Dad are leaving this morning for a few days to themselves. Best wishes to them. Jennifer and daughter Stacy (aunt and cousin, respectively) are coming for the duration.</p>

<p>Aaron was a bit distraught this morning at the lack of apparent justice. Someone ate two poptarts. ... He feels very strongly about justice.</p>

<p>My English paper on Macbeth (more specifically, the importance of solilquies) is only two pages long. But it&#8217;s double spaced and in 10pt Garamond, so&#8230; hm. I need to bring up my B, though, so hopefully it&#8217;ll be decent enough.</p>

Which, as someone pointed out, <em>is</em> rather a good thing&#8230; Anyhoo, I had a friend of mine in New York record the female parts over the internet. :) Fun.

<p>I have training for work at Magic Joe&#8217;s from 1-6 this afternoon. I take this to mean that I <em>have</em> gotten the job there (it&#8217;s a chain of little drive-through coffee huts), though I haven&#8217;t really been <em>informed</em> that. The email that I got from them regarding training said something along the lines of &#8220;You&#8217;ll remember that we had talked about you getting a job at Magic Joe&#8217;s. We have you scheduled for training on Saturday&#8230;&#8221;, so I assume that that&#8217;s meant to mean that I&#8217;m hired. :) I&#8217;m on the work schedule, anyway.</p>

2006-01-09 15:21:53,Monday Morning,"<p>I dreamt (dreamed?) that I woke up. Twice, I think. I remembered that I had to take Hannah in to school for drivers&#8217; ed, then found myself <em>at</em> school with the clocks saying 8:03. After wondering to myself about how I could have gotten to school at 8:03, I and a spattering of Student Council members ended up in a Supreme Council meeting in an apartment meeting, discussing an older tenant&#8217;s monthly fee. Or something.</p>

<p>So now I&#8217;m <em>at</em> school, and I seem to have left my keys at home. How&#8217;d <em>that</em> happen?</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s my excuse for my reaction to the succession of slides that I found myself in the middle of, driving home through the backroads from piano lessons. :/ That wasn&#8217;t much fun, honestly. I&#8217;m extremely thankful that I&#8217;m at home where I&#8217;ll see my family again in the morning instead of&#8230; not. Or whatever. Maybe I&#8217;m overreacting, but&#8230; ee.</p>

<p>Speaking of pianoing, lessons went well. Bruce&#8217;s only going to be around for another two weeks, which means only one more lesson from him.

Being entirely politically uninformed (-ish), my answers to the questions (which followed the general form of &#8220;Were you aware that&#8230;&#8221;) were always 2. Signifying &#8220;no&#8221;.</p>

<p>The second to the last question was &#8220;Would you be willing to call [ a senator, methinks ] today and [ tell him something ]?&#8221; 2. &#8220;The number to call [ the aforementioned senator ] is [ phone number ]. Would you like to hear that number again?&#8221; 2.</p>

<p>:) I admire the guys for their campaigning, and they get bonus points for using a survey method that&#8217;s relatively unobtrusive and something that I haven&#8217;t seen (heard?) before. Negative points for being a bit excessively biased and&#8230; whatever the word is for not-being-truely-interactive-because-it-ignores-the-answers-provided-when-presenting-new-questions, but they still come out positive.</p>

2006-01-16 04:47:33,"Life, the Universe and Everything","<p>Haven&#8217;t posted here for a while, so what follows will be a synopsis of the last&#8230; however many days I haven&#8217;t written anything. :)</p>

<ol>
<li>Decathlon competition was on Friday. Our team ended up fourth out of the eleven competing, and it looks like we have a decent chance of advancing on to State-level competition. The USAD (US Academic Decathlon) group is already $20000 in debt for this year&#8217;s stuff, from what I hear, so it seems that there may <em>be</em> no competition next year. A pity, considering that it&#8217;s the third-largest national academic organization.</li>
<li>Oh! The regional competition was held at the Student Center at UWSP, and I picked up a 256mb flash drive from the student store. :) I needed one. It&#8217;s not USB2, unfortunately, but that&#8217;s what you get for $35.</li>
<li>Hannah drove the truck to Fort with Dad&#8217;s guidance, and me in the backseat (I needed the truck afterwards to jump my car which was still in the school parking lot from the night before when we had gotten back from Stevens Point; the battery died, which was the last problem that I was expecting &#8211; I had bent my car key on that darn plastic package from the flash drive and was afraid that the key wouldn&#8217;t work). I was half asleep the whole time and Hannah&#8217;s driving&#8230; well, it&#8217;s improving. &#8220;No, Hannah, you&#8217;re in fifth. You need to be in third gear.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m not in third? Where&#8217;s third?&#8221; &#8220;Put it back into nuetral and push the stick up.&#8221; &#8220;Put it in nuetral&#8230;&#8221; Isaac: &#8220;Stay on the road!&#8221;</li>
<li>My computer&#8217;s sound is dead. It&#8217;s a little depressing; I like to listen to music while I work. Can&#8217;t imagine what&#8217;s wrong with it; everything <em>seems</em> to be working (as in it&#8217;s generating audio levels) so you&#8217;d think that it&#8217;d be a problem with the speakers or something. It&#8217;s not, suffice it to say, so&#8230; gah. Anthony! Help!</li>

I didn&#8217;t realize it until <em>after</em> I logged in, and not wanting to wait another hour for this machine to restart, went ahead and worked <em>without</em> it. What a pain. Though I did manage to get a copy of Firefox running on my flash drive&#8230;</p>

<p>Hurrah! Goldworthy just got the email &#8211; our Decathlon team&#8217;s going on to state!</p>

",exigraff wp_posts.csv
2006-01-17 22:07:00,Keylogging is unethical.,"<p>But <em>almost</em> understandable when used on a public-use network. Only&#8230; hm. My <em>school&#8217;s</em> network isn&#8217;t for public use, per se. Whatever. There&#8217;s a clause in the usage rules that syas that &#8221;[u]sers should not expect that files stored on District servers and hard drives will always be private&#8221;, but that only pertains to files. Stored on servers <em>and</em> hard drives, no less (methinks that this policy needs to be re-written).</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t really have a problem with keyloggers personally, as I don&#8217;t have anything to hide with what I use the network <em>for</em>. The problem that I <em>do</em> have with it is that it logs passwords. ... Which is what it&#8217;s <em>supposed</em> to do, but honestly, is that&#8230; right? <em>Anything</em> that a user types in on a workstation connected to the network is subject to review by an administrator, and if the previledged few have unrestricted access to this information&#8230; where&#8217;s the accountability? How do I know that my passwords aren&#8217;t being hijacked by the admins, or that the teachers who do their banking online from school are having the security of their accounts compromised?</p>

<p>The obvious solution is to only do your &#8220;secure&#8221; stuff at home, but honestly&#8230; is this really necessary? It makes sense to have some service monitoring what&#8217;s being done on the workstations here (i.e. something that might alert an administrator if profanity or other junk is typed), but actually <em>logging</em> everything that&#8217;s typed&#8230; seems unethical. <em>And</em> a waste of resources, if it comes to that.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong><br />
Yay for post number 123. My school&#8217;s using Aristotle DataVault for their&#8230; monitoring stuff, and access to the keylogger&#8217;s data evidently both requires a password and is logged. But still&#8230; of what benefit is that? The same people who <em>use</em> the keylogger data are the ones who would look at the access log for those who use that data anyway.</p>

<p>Not that I suspect the network admins to be doing this kind of thing at all, it&#8217;s just&#8230; I don&#8217;t like the concept. Again, it seems&#8230; yeah, unethical.</p>

<p>Not to repeat myself or anything.</p>

<p><strong>Another Edit</strong><br />
Point 10 of the usage policy (which I quoted earlier) also says that the &#8221;[n]etwork administrators may review files and communications to maintain system integrity and insure that users are using the system responsibly.&#8221; Communications &#8211; ah. &#8221;[R]eview&#8221;, implying that the &#8220;communications&#8221; have been saved. I wonder how many of the non-tech-related faculty know about this?</p>

<p>Gah&#8230; There&#8217;s not point in writing about this. Nothing&#8217;s going to change &#8211; this is the system, this is how it&#8217;s been and how it&#8217;s likely going to continue to be. I knew earlier that they had a service <em>monitoring</em> workstation usage, but not that they were logging everything. That changes things a bit.</p>

<p>Dang it. Now I can&#8217;t <em>do</em> anything. At all &#8211; everything that I use the internet for requires authentication, and every password (along with everything else) is logged. I <em>really</em> don&#8217;t feel comfortable with that, even for my <a href=""http://rhscouncil.org"">Council</a> admin account. Everything&#8217;s logged&#8230; Sounds&#8230; Communist? Nah. Sounds uber-responsible administration, or something.</p>

<p>Some people have speculated that looser restrictions inspire a fewer number of <em>broken</em> restrictions. Yes, those people are idealists (humanity as a whole is not very intelligent), but it does make sense. To a degree. It would make sense if we were discussing the public library&#8217;s network, for example (albeit not a <em>good</em> example), but not for a high school. Especially for a high school.</p>

<p>So&#8230; I don&#8217;t know what I think. Monitoring the activity of network users, okay. But at the very least, users should be explicitly warned <em>as they are monitored</em>. Okay, there&#8217;s a warning in the usage rules. Okay, there are little signs up in the library. But if call centers are required to make little beeping sounds if the conversation is being logged and if school buses are required to post signs with they have cameras on board&#8230;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s all the same, isn&#8217;t it? ... This is dumb; I&#8217;m arguing with myself and loosing. I&#8217;m not even sure if US privacy law applies to minors, which the majority of the school&#8217;s students are.</p>

<p>&#8230; Never mind, that&#8217;s a lie. Looking at my day, a good majority of it goes well. Sleep (7-8 hours) usually is fine, 3/4 to the entire school day is generally fine. That&#8217;s the bulk of it right there, so as far as greater percentage of my time spent goes, I&#8217;m doing well. But then you get <em>home</em> after a 12 hour day at school to find an email from a dissatisfied client and more emails from other clients and people waiting on you for help/service and homework to do and a family to try and connect to and petty little self-comprehension issues that are entirely pointless&#8230;</p>

I&#8217;ve got some kind of fever/swollen-throat/sinus thing that&#8217;s been on my back for the last two or three days. Would have stayed home from church this morning, but I needed to piano for Children&#8217;s Ministry and I was on duty for the sound system for second service.</p>

<p>Mom read the next few chapters of Alice in Wonderland for the masses this evening. Love that book. :) Reminds me of Swift&#8217;s Gulliver&#8217;s Travels, actually&#8230; I&#8217;m online now only to receive my upteenth-million messages (give or take) that I haven&#8217;t checked since Friday, among them being a letter from a client that&#8230; yeah.</p>

<p>That particular project hasn&#8217;t gone terribly well, as far as keeping up with my quote for worktime needed. It&#8217;s gone excellently otherwise, but my quote was, more or less 1000% off. :) The project involves taking 10 years worth of monthly magazines that a since deceased man wrote and preparing them for web-based presentation. Very tedius work. I quoted him 15 hours, but the actual number is likely to be&#8230; much higher. After having it proofed by Mom and Dad (nothing wrong with that), I sent the client a rather length letter explaining the situation and offering a few possible routes for completing the project. Thankfully, the guy&#8217;s reasonable and can understand the depth of the situation at hand. Projects are never fun when the client doesn&#8217;t have a clue.</p>

<p>So anyway&#8230; I&#8217;m going to bed. Night.</p>

2006-02-03 04:33:10,Still Sick. :),"<p>Yep. Sinus infection, looks like. Makes sense, considering the pressure in my sinuses and the aching top teeth. And the blood. :/</p>

<p>So&#8230; Went ice fishing today for Winter Outdoor. Szews (the teacher; pronounced &#8220;Zeus&#8221; for all practical reasons) keeps going on about how wonderful it is to be outside enjoying the weather, and <em>all</em> for school credit. I&#8230; yeah, can&#8217;t quite bring myself to see it that way. Using taxpayer dollars to buy tipups and jig poles (not to mention live bait) for an activity that isn&#8217;t <em>remotely</em>... well, it is remotely educational. I, personally, didn&#8217;t know that inserting a hook just below the backbone of a minnow felt like sticking a paperclip through&#8230; stiff gelatin, but now I know. So much for that.</p>

<p>Ah well. The class <em>did</em> catch 200-something inches of fish, more than double that of the previous hour for the day. ... How&#8230; gah. Look, my group of kids dragged <em>lots</em> more fish out of their natural habitat and into an atmosphere that their lungs can&#8217;t work in than <em>your</em> group did!</p>

<p>Hurrah. :)</p>

2006-02-06 15:28:32,Networking and Such,"<p>Dad and I spent roughly 3 hours last night getting the wireless AP functioning in the right spot. The station spent $120-ish for a Hawking access point and signal booster, and when mounted in the right place it&#8217;s sufficient to bring the signal over to the house. :) Broadband, and free broadband at that. I&#8217;m very happy.</p>

<p>Took honestly longer than it should have, though. I must have re-wired the ethernet cable ends three times before I got it to work. Really, it shouldn&#8217;t matter how the little colored cables are in order, as long as the order is the same for both ends. But evidently, it mattered in this scenario. Go figure.</p>

<p>Lyndon said that he&#8217;d sell my tablet on eBay for me, as I&#8217;m not <em>quite</em> 18 yet and my parents don&#8217;t care to give eBay both their credit card number and checking acct info. Ah well. The photos and description of the machine are almost ready&#8230; I think I&#8217;m going to try dumping the keyboard in a bath of distilled water and see if that fixes it. It still hasn&#8217;t gotten over that Dew spill. And the screen needs to have its insides cleaned out again&#8230; Toshiba didn&#8217;t do a very good job with that dust-proof screen protector.</p>

He&#8217;s 6 timezones away, which makes collab a bit difficult, considering that I&#8217;m a fulltime student. Yech. So we scheduled a teleconference, as stated, for 5:30 my time (11:30 for him). I duely set my alarm clock last night for 5:00 am and spent the entire night waking up at odd hours in anticipation for the alarm clock, which really defeated the purpose of setting the alarm at all.</p>

<p>5:00 came, as 5:00 generally does. Showered and booted my computer, then waited for Peter to show up. He didn&#8217;t. At around 5:42 I began to have some doubt as to the scheduled time of the conference, so I checked my message logs to find the time that we decided on.

Didn&#8217;t go too badly, except that one guy requested that I play &#8220;Unchained Melody&#8221;, which I darn <em>well</em> should have known (I have the music in my Show Choir folder) but couldn&#8217;t recall at the time. Gah.</p>

<p>Anyway&#8230; I played for two hours, apparently. My watch skipped an unknown amount of time again so I couldn&#8217;t tell how quickly time was really passing, and time has a tendency to completely slip away while I&#8217;m pianoing. But it ended up at two hours. Good enough.</p>

Went well, though I ended up being interviewed twice by the same panel through some clerical error. Or something.</p>
<p>The interviewers gave us feedback in a group discussion/meeting afterwards, and while their feedback was <em>good</em>...

Said so on the bumper. The little sign on top declaring &#8220;Student Driver&#8221; was missing (that, and it was 5:50-ish) made it plausible that Mr. C was driving the vehicle (the bumper also said &#8220;Mr. C&#8217;s Driving School&#8221;), which I found mildly interesting.

<p>The fiasco started last night when I was adding a printer in the office building to my computer at home (they&#8217;re both wireless). It looked like it was working perfectly, but then&#8230; my computer rebooted. Didn&#8217;t go through the shutdown faze, it just rebooted. Odd. So I logged back in and started having Google Desktop and Trillian yell at me about how their respective dlls weren&#8217;t valid images of Windows, or something to that effect. And then it rebooted again. And again.</p>

I&#8217;ve more or less given up on totally repairing the data on the drive, so I&#8217;m trying to get the crucial data <em>off</em> of it and onto my external 250gb drive. The primary one won&#8217;t boot, but neither will Hannah&#8217;s when I&#8217;ve got that bad drive in there. Yech. And my Ubuntu liveCD can&#8217;t access either drive, evidently.

<p>Council meeting was first hour&#8230; didn&#8217;t go too badly. Werbowsky did show up, but didn&#8217;t go on about the online arcade. A good thing, too; it didn&#8217;t need to be&#8230; gone on about. George (advisor) kinda chewed me out in an officer&#8217;s meeting. :) Ah well. I had put an arcade on the Council website for Council-only use, but didn&#8217;t know of a good way to block it from at-school access without writing a specific hack for the system. So it just kind of fell to the wayside and a Council member ended up using the arcade at school. Got caught, of course, and got the Student Council website blocked at school, providing me with ample incentive to figure out that block thing. Turned out the only thing that I needed to do was add a couple lines to the .htaccess for the folder:</p>
<p>order allow,deny<br />
deny from xxx.xxx.xxx.<br />
allow from all</p>
<p>Simple enough. Leaving the last few digits of the IP address out lets it block the entire range of addresses.

This Sunday we celebrate Easter, the most holy of days and<br />
crowning feast of the church year. We rejoice in the radiance of the<br />
Resurrection and the victory of our mighty King, who<br />
vanquished sin and death.</p>
<p>With shouts of &#8220;Alleluia, Christ is risen!&#8221; we herald the pivotal<br />
moment of human history, for which all of Scripture was a preamble,<br />
the moment in which time and eternity collided. With choirs of angels<br />
we glimpse the grand extravagance of God&#8217;s grace. And with St.<br />
Peter we can say, &#8220;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus<br />
Christ! By his great mercy he has given us a new birth into a living<br />
hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead&#8221; (1 Pt.<br />
1:3).</p>
<p>Russell and I would like to wish you a blessed and<br />
joyful Easter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord is risen indeed. Alleluia!&#8221;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />
Amen. Cool! :) This is one of the few Christianity-related entries here, but that category definitely deserves representation. Honestly, without that faith, life has a total lack of purpose.

<p><em>Like eveything I&#8217;ve seen by Tim Burton, this film is at one and the same time, warm and frightening, tender and heart-wrenchingly evil, uplifting and dark. The good and bad in humanity are shown in stark relief quite clearly for everyone to see. But in the final analysis, the most important message the film has to offer is this: Love truly does make the world go &#8216;round and redemption and just living to see another day is a kind of victory.</em></p>
<p>Appropriately sappy at the end, but that does about sum it up. I heard someone call this &#8220;one of Depp&#8217;s finest roles&#8221;. ... Yeah, that&#8217;s pretty close.</p>
<p>On a slightly more practical note, I&#8217;d love to see this movie redone. <em>Carefully</em> redone. Or maybe just added to &#8211; there were a couple incidents where a lack in effects were actually a distraction from where the movie was going. Could be just me. :)</p>

2006-04-25 02:03:00,Webby Awards - Best Visual Design - Aesthetic,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/37.jpg"" /></p>	<p>Google alerted me to a news article entitled &#8220;<a href=""http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=2915"">Corporate PCs: Underpowered for Vista. Overpowered for Writely?</a>&#8221;, wherein &#8220;Google&#8217;s Writely&#8221; was mentioned. Not having heard of this service before, I Googled &#8220;<a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=google+writely&#38;start=0&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;client=firefox-a&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official"">google writely</a>&#8221; and consequently discovered <a href=""http://writely.com"">Writely</a>, an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX"">AJAX</a> service (yes, Google&#8217;s notorious for those) that takes the place of a more standard install-this-software-on-your-machine-and-don&#8217;t-pirate-it-or-we&#8217;ll-kill-you package. Not bad. I&#8217;ll sign up when the <a href=""http://writely.blogspot.com/2006/03/google-yep-google.html"">move to Google</a> is complete.</p>
<p>But I digress. Writely has also been <a href=""http://writely.blogspot.com/2006/04/wanna-webby-we-do.html"">nominated for a Webby award in Best Practices and Service</a>, which is pretty darn cool &#8211; they&#8217;re on the ballot right up next to <a href=""http://flickr.com"">Flickr</a>, <a href=""http://shutterfly.com"">Shutterfly, Inc.</a> and <a href=""http://maps.google.com"">Google Maps</a>. Whilst perusing <a href=""http://peoplesvoice.webbyawards.com/ballot_menu.mhtml"">the ballot listings at Webby</a>, I noticed a category for <a href=""http://peoplesvoice.webbyawards.com/category_vote.mhtml?cat_id=87"">Best Visual Design &#8211; Aesthetic</a>. Ah &#8211; a category after&#8230; my own heart. Yep. From the 5 listed, my vote went to <a href=""http://demo.arcww.ca/sites/lblaunch/"">Big Ideas Come From Big Pencils</a>. <a href=""http://www.bigfatinstitute.org/"">BFI</a> and <a href=""http://www.bovineunite.com/moo.htm"">Bovine Unite</a> were just too alike &#8211; going after that vintage look. <a href=""http://www.stylewars.com/"">Style Wars</a> just wasn&#8217;t appealing (personal taste) and <a href=""http://www.remembersegregation.org/"">Remember Segregation</a>... Suffice it to say that I&#8217;ve had it to the hilt with minority groups shouting louder than the majority. In all fairness, they weren&#8217;t bad, but even just based on the design (like it should be), they wouldn&#8217;t have won my vote.</p>
<p>But the Big Ideas exhibit&#8230; wow. Innovation, aesthetics&#8230; wow. One quote from Leo (#65; it&#8217;s the far upper-left apple) did a particularly good job of summing up the site (funny&#8230;), but I&#8217;ll make you look for it. <a href=""http://demo.arcww.ca/sites/lblaunch/"">Click here</a>.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>Edit: Leo Burnett&#8217;s official site is <a href=""http://www.leoburnett.com/"">here</a> &#8211; the other one was solely a demo for the Webby Awards, methinks.</p>
<p>Edit again: Right, I&#8217;m going to retract that comment about segregation. I still don&#8217;t like minority activist groups, but the website is anything but an outlet for such a group. My bad.</p>

2006-04-26 00:13:00,Commentary of Bush's Remarks on Energy,"<p>I&#8217;m reading through the <a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&#38;STORY=/www/story/04-25-2006/0004347312&#38;EDATE= "">transcript</a> of Bush&#8217;s last set of remarks&#8230;</p>
<p><em>... I&#8217;m here to talk to<br />
you about the contributions you are making&#8230;</em><br />
Oh, that&#8217;s grand. They might already know about those, though.</p>
<p><em>Before I talk about energy, I do want to share with you some thoughts about the war on terror&#8230;</em><br />
What?!?</p>
<p><em>Yet amongst this hopeful&#8212;these hopeful signs, there&#8217;s an area of<br />
serious concern, and that is high energy prices.</em><br />
And the alarming rate at which America is falling behind the education curves of Eastern countries and their rates of innovation and development isn&#8217;t serious? And yeah, the American public is incredibly un-informed, but doesn&#8217;t high prices seem like more of an indicator? Rather than a problem in and of itself?</p>
<p><em>Addiction to oil is a matter of national security concerns.</em><br />
That is a problem, and kudos for picking up on it, but&#8230; national security?</p>
<p>_If we&#8217;re trying to conserve energy, if we want to become less dependent on oil, let&#8217;s provide incentives for consumers to use less energy. _<br />
Sadly enough, that&#8217;s the only way to do it&#8230; Oi, our psychology makes us look like primates.</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve directed the Department of Energy to defer filling the reserve this summer.</em><br />
... That makes me feel a bit uneasy.</p>
<p><em>Our strategic reserve is sufficiently large enough to guard<br />
against any major supply disruption over the next few months. So by deferring deposits until the fall, we&#8217;ll leave a little more oil on the market.</em><br />
Still not helping.</p>
<p><em>One of the issues, as you know, that has been confronting Congress is ANWR.</em><br />
Hiding it with acronyms&#8230; yay beaurocratics.</p>
<p><em>Technology is the way, really, to help us&#8212;to help change America for the better.</em><br />
Amen. But who&#8217;s going to <em>create</em> it? All the engineers are in <em>Asia</em> (more power to them, though) and there are fewer and fewer youth going into science and engineering than ever! Geeah!</p>
<p><em>Ethanol is home-grown. Ethanol will replace gasoline consumption.</em><br />
Hopefully, but if we keep telling ourselves that it might happen.</p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s a good&#8212;ethanol is good for the whole country, and we&#8217;ve been&#8212;(applause.) I thought you&#8217;d like that. (Laughter.)</em><br />
Cater to the audience.</p>
<p><em>Last year America used a record 4 billion gallons of ethanol.</em><br />
This is all well and good, but in <em>2002</em> we were using nearly 20 <em>billion</em> gallons of oil every <em>month</em>.</p>
<p><em>And so I am committed to furthering technology research to find other ways, other sources of ethanol.</em><br />
If you can do it, man, do it.</p>
<p><em>And we&#8217;re pretty close to a breakthrough. We believe we&#8217;re close to a technology that will make it possible to drive up to 40 miles on<br />
electricity alone. And then if you have to drive more than 40 miles, then your gasoline kicks in.</em><br />
[ snorts ]</p>
<p><em>But you can imagine what that will mean for a lot of drivers in big<br />
cities who on a daily basis, they don&#8217;t drive over 40 miles.</em><br />
Flawed logic, to a point, but still a semi-valid point.</p>
<p><em>You know, there&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that one of these days, instead of people driving up to a gas station, they&#8217;re going to be going up to a fueling station.</em><br />
<em>This</em> is going in the next Bushisms book.</p>
<p><em>We owe it to the American people to be aggressive on price gouging now.</em><br />
[ blinks ] Why? What has the American <em>people</em> done?</p>
<p>At least he&#8217;s trying to do something. That&#8217;s all anyone can do, and more power to him for that.</p>

<p>The selling points? A new look (they cut out a few buttons), tabs (hasn&#8217;t Mozilla/Firefox been doing this all along?), better printing (a good thing &#8211; this needed improvement), RSS feeds (yep, Firefox), multiple search provider things (Firefox), and better security (Firefox, although the IE7 security alerts do look like they might go beyond what Firefox&#8217;s done).</p>

I just opened up IE7. First reaction: &#8221;... Ew.&#8221; Maybe it looks better when&#8230; ah, it does. The design was meant to go with the XP look, not the more traditional/standard theme.</p>
<p>So. First page: should I enable the phishing filter? Why not. Let&#8217;s open up a tab and see what happens. Ctrl+t &#8211; oh! &#8220;You&#8217;ve opened a new tab.&#8221; Oh. Oh <em>ho</em>. [ laughs ]</p>

<p><em>Not</em> on my list is a logo for the Council. We&#8217;re painfully without one, but this might pull it&#8230; it&#8217;s a bit abstract, but I&#8217;ll check with the masses before making it official. Promise.</p>

2006-05-01 03:58:29,Prom and things,"<p>Ben and I weren&#8217;t intending to go to Prom; we were just going to go bowling for an hour or so and then head to post-Prom at the Cinema. The Prom advisor, however, gave me two tickets for helping the Court out with their intro audio, so&#8230; off we went. Both wearing suitcoats and shades, no less.</p>
<p>Prom wasn&#8217;t bad. Quite definitely better than Snoball, but there you are. :) The DJ, as Matt put it, &#8220;had his good times and his bad times.&#8221;  He played the <a href=""http://hampsterdance.com"">hampster dance</a> right before the end (a good move), but played the Barbi song (&#8220;I&#8217;m a Barbi girl&#8230;&#8221;) directly afterwards. Which is why we left. :D The only restaurant open at 11:45 pm is Taco Bell, I believe.</p>
<p>So&#8230; Got home at 2:45am-ish, having Sunday School and such (later) this morning. A kid at SS had just been to two subsequent sleepovers, resulting in about 4 hours of sleep against the past 44 hours of consciousness (-ish). Poor guy&#8230; he broke down right in the middle of the lesson. Ee.</p>
<p>Slept for 4-5 hours this afternoon, then helped Dad out with a patch job at greenhouse 4. The pressure from the inflated plastic walls raised up the wooden rails on either side, leaving a gap underneath that needed filling.</p>
<p>And <em>now</em> I just found out that I exceeded my alloted 6 automated transactions with my bank account and have had a few services disabled until the end of the month (today, incidentally), in addition to the charge of a $20 fine. Geeah. Who knew&#8230;</p>

<p>I gave in. Surrendered, compromised my ideals. MySpace now has posession of ikebowen. But not entirely &#8211; I&#8217;m still holding out against the machine that has made fools of the American youth (and taken a good part of the American non-youth along with them).</p>
<p>The thing about MySpace that makes it so darn viral is that you can&#8217;t do <em>anything</em> with it unless you immerse yourself fully in it. Do you want to post a comment about someone&#8217;s photo (this is where it started for me)? Join MySpace. Oops, sorry, you have to be that person&#8217;s &#8220;friend&#8221; first. Ask nicely. Okay, <em>now</em> you can post that comment. Oh, look! Your brand-new-shiny friend has <em>other</em> friends that you know! Talk to them! But&#8230; yep, you have to be <em>their</em> friends too! Weeeeee!</p>
<p>[ shudders ] It&#8217;s uncanny. People get sucked into this and&#8230; eeee. A <del>friend</del> acquaintance of mine had this to say to a &#8220;friend&#8221; of hers who had just given in:</p>
<p><em>You are here! I am so excited&#8230;now i can communicate with you easier, much easier!</em></p>
<p>[ blinks ] Does this not sound&#8230; I want to say <em>cultish</em>, but it&#8217;s not. Or maybe it is. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>A college in Texas <a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12459826/"">recently banned MySpace</a> on their network. More power to them. When &#8221;[T]he library is pretty much full with people on MySpace&#8221;, there&#8217;s a problem. On the other hand, consider this: &#8220;We pay for school and the resources that are used,&#8221; said Zeke Santos, 20. &#8220;It&#8217;s our choice, we&#8217;re the ones paying for our classes. If we pass or fail, it&#8217;s up to us.&#8221;</p>

2006-05-13 21:09:00,Romeo and Juliet,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/49.gif"" /></p>	<p>Mom bought what were probably the last 7 seats in a row for last night&#8217;s performance. It was excellent &#8211; I was very impressed. Ethan got a bit impatient for the actors to start dying, oddly enough. Then again, it was three hours long.</p>
<p>There was this little kid sitting on my right for half of the play. Devin, I think. Bit antsy and with some kind of plastic bag in his pocket.</p>
<p>Aaron rode home with me afterwards. We were intending to stop for gas and then pick up his tree from Central School, so we swung around on Kemp St. Didn&#8217;t stop at the BP (not a very nice one), but finding that the station further down the street was closed, we ended up going to Central first and <em>then</em> stopping on Stevens St. Turns out that, unlike my Bonneville, the Intrepid has the tank on the right. Not thinking very clearly, I pulled the car around to the right to another pump and got out. Hm, the tank <em>still</em> isn&#8217;t on this side of the car. So I stand there trying to think at 11:00pm (-ish), and there&#8217;s this lady filling up her truck on the other end of the station, just looking at me. No, I&#8217;m not crazy. ... Anyhoo, it was easiest to just turn around and back in. Ah well.</p>
<p>The network wasn&#8217;t working at all this morning, which is a bit of a first. The wireless network was <em>present</em>, but no DHCP activity. Rebooting the LAN router, the DSL box and the wireless AP didn&#8217;t have any effect, but further inspection of the router revealed that someone had plugged a client box into the broadband uplink instead of the DSL box. Go figure.</p>

2006-05-16 04:28:00,Monday Monday...,"<p>And so it is. Definitely not ready for the week.</p>
<p>Worked on music after school with Calah and Emma. Calah <em>and</em> P were both in rare moods&#8230; Calah&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t terribly pleasant, while P&#8217;s was more of a spot of whatever mutation of senioritis that teachers get.</p>
<p>This evening we musicked for a dinner in honor of those nearing senior age that volunteer for senior citizens. The Country Club (the one on Boom Lake, not the other two) is probably the worst place to perform if you don&#8217;t have your own traveling gear. The house audio is nothing more than a PA system, and the wireless mic (yes, they have a wireless mic, oddly enough) peaks the system every time its used. I brought my piano and amp, which Calah ended up sharing. The amp, not the piano. Ah well. Emma fluted to some Phantom music with my accompaniment &#8211; she&#8217;s one of the rare ones that are <em>very</em> easy to do music with. I like it. She and Calah&#8230;</p>
<p>Then the School Board meeting at 6:30, which is in the LGI. Not at Admin. My only role this time was to be introduced as the incoming Council Prez and to exposÃ© on the recent and upcoming elections and such. I&#8217;m not sure if exposÃ© is a real word, and if it is, I&#8217;m likely using it out of context. So it goes.</p>
<p>Methinks I&#8217;m going to call Calah or someone tonight&#8230; Perhaps Danielle. I need to talk to someone.</p>

2006-05-17 02:29:00,Skype and Free Calling,"<p>Hm. So &#8211; Skype&#8217;s declared open season on all pc-to-landline/mobile calling in the US and Canada until the end of the year. While this is a <em>very</em> nice little offer, mightn&#8217;t it be a bit&#8230; rash? I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ve thought through it, but suddenly <em>anyone</em> can call <em>anyone anywhere</em> at no cost whatsoever. ... Except bandwidth, but that&#8217;s not really an issue.</p>
<p>For example, for no price, I was able to call someone that I&#8217;ve never met before and who certainly doesn&#8217;t know me and ask them if they&#8217;ve ever been worried about anyone tapping into their phone calls. The person on the other end wasn&#8217;t at all, and laughed at the idea, but do you see what I mean? There can&#8217;t be much danger, but this seems like it kind of opens up the doors for pranksters and scammers (and independent pollsters) alike.</p>
<p>But I like free calling. I can make calls while my sister&#8217;s using our petty landline connection.</p>
<p>One more thing: why hasn&#8217;t this change been acknowledged much at skype.com? Aside from a little purple voice bubble on the front page (note to designers: that&#8217;s cute), there&#8217;s nothing. Even the Skype client doesn&#8217;t take much note, other than not charging you for the calls &#8211; you still get the little notices blathering on about buying Skype credit before making SkypeOut connections.</p>

2006-05-25 06:12:11,Midway through the week,"<p>&#8220;Isaac, can you pick me up after school if it&#8217;s raining? If it&#8217;s not, I don&#8217;t need a ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>Righto, Ethan. Anyway, it didn&#8217;t rain until 6:15-ish. And yes, it did rain. Really hard &#8211; like those huge raindrops that hit your windshield like hail but splat apart like soft paintballs instead of shattering the glass.</p>
<p>Went to Youth Group tonight, seeing as how it&#8217;s the last one of the year. We usually have a family Bible study instead, but Mom and Dad were okay with pushing it back to Thursday. I arrived a bit late, having forgotten that they actually start at 6:00, not 6:30. Then again, the first half hour consisted of the worship session, which really&#8230; Ee. There was no worship there. This was an instance of the program getting in the way of the worship. A music video with words overlayed, projected in a dark sanctuary&#8230; Potential, but it didn&#8217;t seem to work. Ah well. Mike&#8217;s teaching was excellent, as usual. This week was the final lesson in his series on Elijah.</p>
<p>The rain had lessened, but was still relatively&#8230; something. Can&#8217;t think of the appropriate adjective. I dropped in on baccaleuoreate afterwards. The service (service?) was half over by the time I got there, so I waited in the back. It had a comfortable feel, considering that the auditorium wasn&#8217;t hardly filled. Nice. I liked it. And there was the coolest ambience audible from the back&#8230; Let me try to describe it in prose.</p>
<p>Gah. Fritz sneaked past me and up the stairs again. Back, dog! To the porch with you!</p>
<p>The ambience had two distinct layers, not including the audio from the service (service?) up front. Imagine sitting at the back and at the center of the left third of a large auditorium, roughly 300&#215;200x50ft. Got it? Now listen to the sound like the one used for large ships (or airplanes in minor turbulence) and such in movies &#8211; an engine base, gently grinding and moving. This is 40 degrees to your left and 50 degrees up fron the horizontal. The second layer is a bit more tricky to describe. If one were to take a ping-pong ball made of some metallic alloy instead of plastic and bounce it once on the concrete floor of a theatre, and if the bounce was more of a &#8220;pong&#8221; than a &#8220;ping&#8221;, then that&#8217;s what this would sound like. An erratic series of semi-metallic pongs (think almost like the child of a marimba and a pan flute, but not <em>quite</em>) coming from 15 degrees below you and 10 degrees to your right, ahead 250 feet and inside the wall, coming in two alternate tones: one tonic, and one fifth up from that.</p>
<p>Sounds strange, I know, but that&#8217;s the best I can do. I wish there was a way to capture the way that things <em>sound</em> to the human ear, or how things <em>look</em> when you see them. I see things, I hear things that I want to keep with me forever, but a mike and a camera can&#8217;t do them justice. A microphone can&#8217;t capture the sound echoing through a piano that&#8217;s ever-so-slightly missed its prime, sitting in an empty chorus room. That&#8217;s the kind of thing that I want to keep. Wish I could.</p>

<p>Do let me tell you why, as long as you&#8217;re here.</p>

<p><strong>Incident the First: Jim Bob the Photographer</strong><br />
After drowning my day in a cold glass (well, a plastic glass, probably manufactured by WalMart, the antithesis of entrepreneurship and, ironically, the <em>image</em> of capitalism) of Mountain Dew (also from WalMart &#8211; two 12-packs for $5), my mom deposited a few items from the days mail on my desk. Underneath the little thank-you note from the Y and on top of yet another college mailing (which may actually have been hand-signed by the admissions counselor) was an envelope, larger than your normal business or card size, but not large enough to be considered overkill. In fact, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen anyone professional use this size envelope before&#8230; (Mental note: check on any correlation between envelope size and quality of content. Later.)</p>

<p>The envelope itself should have been a warning. #1: The use of a font <em>designed</em> to look like sloppy handwriting. The personal touch. #2: No effort made to hide #1 &#8211; same font used three times in different colors and sizes. Gah.</p>

<p>Page one is to your left. Can you say &#8220;Spam in print!&#8221;? <em>The &#8220;fine print&#8221; is the small type with the &#8220;*&#8221; next to it&#8230;</em> Ah, thanks. A selection of fine print: &#8220;I always knew we would go with &#8212;&#8212; for those important photos.&#8221; So&#8230; they didn&#8217;t act on one of these consumer alerts?</p>

<p>So yes, this is a senior photographer that I&#8217;m talking about, and one that is in bad need of either an advertising agent or&#8230; Yes, I&#8217;ve blurred out his name on these scans. No need to sway anyone&#8217;s decisions on where they get their photos taken, which brings up an interesting point that I&#8217;ll put back down until I&#8217;m done with my treatise.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll spare you the entire document, but I will give you an extended sample and will cheerfully let you read it for youself while I get control over my gag reflex. The form is interesting &#8211; you&#8217;ll note that &#8220;June 15&#8221; is typewritten and printed (albeit in red). What, then, was the point of stamping &#8220;<span class=""caps"">JUN</span> 15&#8221; with a <em>stamp</em> on the cover page of this consumer alert? I&#8217;ll leave the little narration alone, but it is worth noting that this guy&#8217;s provided a little form for you to fill out when there&#8217;s only one given scenario (out of three) that would involve said form.</p>

<p>Oi&#8230; I know, I&#8217;ve made a terribly large deal out of this, but I am absolutely disgusted (and rather passionate about quality print design, or lack thereof). A previous generation of [ coughs ] entrepreneurs who haven&#8217;t a clue when it comes to effective advertising and presentation&#8230; shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to do this kind of thing. Or something. I am further inflamed by the fact that he sent this to my <em>parents</em>. My <em>parents?</em> At least give them the respect of addressing this &#8220;consumer alert&#8221; to <em>me</em>, the younger and more impressionable/inexperienced youth, and not to my <em>parents</em>. You <em>insult</em> their intelligence with this. &#8230; Man.</p>

<p>[ deep breath ] On the upside, his photography isn&#8217;t that bad. He included a sample sheet which I won&#8217;t scan because it would probably violate some professional copyright law. It does suprise me, though, that a guy with an eye for good photography would have such a <em>horrendous</em> eye for print design.</p>

<p>Thing is, it worked. A tasteless advertising stunt worked, and better perhaps than some of the other more &#8220;professional&#8221; marketing initiatives have. This&#8230; abomination called more of my attention to it, and in doing so to the guy&#8217;s product, than it likely would have if he had done a better job. So which is better, from a marketer&#8217;s point of view? A campaign that&#8217;s <em>so</em> bad that it actually works, or one that&#8217;s <em>good</em> enough to work? &#8230; Welcome to America. I may have to boycott this photographer.</p>

<p>I have another rant coming on regarding a clichÃ© in Flash (that would be Incident the Second), but it can wait.</p>

<p>Oh look! Lambs!</p>
<p>Half of mi familia went off and brought home two baby lambs (Megan and&#8230; someone else). Hannah and Abbey were bottle-feeding them in the pen outside the house when I got home. The cutest little things&#8230;</p>
<p>And then Abbey introduced me to Emma. Emma is the name of the 6-month-old-today burro that mi padre decided very recently to purchase along with the two lambs. A very last-minute decision; a bit unlike him&#8230;. although it was probably premeditated. Intentional burro-aquisition. In any case, Emma is decidedly the coolest thing yet to walk the ground of her current home. Never mind that its previous occupants have all been pigs (and one horse, but that horse has since demised and therefore doesn&#8217;t count). Emma the burro. I&#8217;m very happy.</p>

2006-06-06 05:19:00,Summer Solstice,"<p>Which it isn&#8217;t, actually, but today was the first real day of <em>summer</em>. As far as I&#8217;m concerned.</p>
<p>Kim&#8217;s brother took her off to a Brewer&#8217;s game today, giving me an extra shift to work. Not that I&#8217;m complaining &#8211; I need all the hours I can get over there. With 2.5 full time employees working at this kiosk thing, the part time folk hardly get any hours in edgewise. I enjoy working there (well, not the cleanup), but I really need to find someplace else.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, someone from <a href=""http://smithbarney.com"">Smith Barney</a> called today about a possible job opportunity. My mom took the message; I&#8217;ll talk to the guy tomorrow. That call made my day. :) But then Ben Murphey stopped by the shpo and made it even better &#8211; he ordered the cheapest non-caffeinated drink we had (italian soda; &#8220;Suprise me&#8221;, he said &#8211; he got a kiwi-vanilla-rum soda, which interestingly enough tastes like root beer) and tipped me a free combo coupon for Hardees, which I didn&#8217;t find out until later.

2006-06-08 05:38:00,Moorish ichthyoids and widescreen analogs,"<p>An eventful day this has been (my young padawan) &#8211; I have taken delivery and am now the proud owner of a 19&#8221; widescreen LCD (which isn&#8217;t really an analog; it also has a digital out that my video card doesn&#8217;t handle) and, on a whim, have purchased a Black Moor.</p>
<p>The Moor first. No, I don&#8217;t have an African Muslim in my basement &#8211; this is a&#8230; [ searches for receipt ]... gah, can&#8217;t find it. I think it was $2.88.. or something close to it. Regardless, this is a relatively inexpensive little fish. He&#8217;s cute, too &#8211; looks a bit like <a href=""http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:xUQhFWO16O5sCM:http://www.bristol-aquarists.org.uk/goldfish/moor/moor2.jpg"">this</a>.</p>
<p>My dear mother referred to him as &#8220;Genghis Kahn&#8221;, and the name&#8217;s stuck. Which is interesting, because Kahn was neither Moorish nor Black, though the Black Moor was originally found in China.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s made his lavish home in a large glass votive candle holder with an assortment of blue shiny glass&#8230; things. None of the fish tanks at Walmart (yes, I got my fish from Walmart) were particularily appealing, so naturally I perused the wedding area of the craft department for candle holders and vases.</p>
<p>My only concern for the poor fellow is that he hasn&#8217;t quite managed to really <em>eat</em> anything. He seems to have trouble getting that little mouth open wide enough to get anything in it, especially when the food flakes are floating on top of the water. Hm.</p>
<p>And now, the monitor. She (yes, she)&#8217;s lovely &#8211; a VA1912wb from ViewSonic, native resolution of 1440&#215;900. <em>My</em> problem is that my NVIDIA GeForce4 MX 440 (with AGP8X, no less) doesn&#8217;t have formal support for that kind of aspect ratio. Which is unfortunate &#8211; I&#8217;m having to deal with 1280&#215;768, which isn&#8217;t bad but could certainly be better. Although, with the font antialiasing, you can&#8217;t really tell. Much.</p>
<p>And yes, ikebowen.com has attained yet another look. I&#8217;ll post a zip of the previous theme later for those who want it; it might be worth keeping.</p>
<p>On an entirely unrelated note, while looking up &#8220;ichthyoid&#8221;, I discovered an entry for &#8220;icky-poo&#8221; in the World Book Dictionary: &#8220;<em>adj. Slang.</em> icky.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong><br />
I installed <a href=""http://www.nvidia.com/page/forceware_geforce.html"">Forceware</a> from NVIDIA, and all&#8217;s well. Sweet beauty at 1440&#215;900. Lovely. The Helios screensaver (&#8220;try it&#8221; &#8211; you&#8217;ll like it) never looked so good.</p>

2006-06-12 01:55:00,The local paper,"<p><em>Note: This paper is my periodically published work, inspired by the ridiculosity (yes, that&#8217;s a word) of my local paper. Scott Adams has my apologies, but that&#8217;s about it.</em></p>
<h1>THE ELBONIAN STAR JOURNAL<sup><a href=""#fn1993316984448cd4c1707ce"">1</a></sup></h1>
<p><em>volume 30, number 8</em></p>
<p><strong>Education, communication among future tribal goals</strong><br />
As the article title implies, these are not among the Lake Elbonia Tribe&#8217;s current goals, but with the cessation of their most recent set of trials and tribulations (namely the legal battle with a mining company that wanted to bring jobs to the area with a proposed mine), the tribe leaders begin to look to the future.</p>
<p>In fact, these future goals had already been forseen by earlier generations of tribe members who had prepared for their arrival, to the best of their ability. Funds were created to ensure that, in future days, such goals could be met: care for the children, education, exposure to modern technology, law enforcement, fire protection and medical care being among the goals planned for.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the leaders of the tribe were cruelly forced to use these funds for other purposes. The legal team hired to fight the battle against the mine company did not come cheaply &#8211; &#8220;several millions of dollars&#8221; were spent to keep the proposed mine out (or at least several miles away from the reservation boundaries).</p>
<p>One would think that this wouldn&#8217;t pose much of a problem &#8211; many tribes are known for obscene profits made in the gambling industry. However, a representative stated that the tribe&#8217;s profits &#8221;[aren&#8217;t] even close&#8221; to that of other tribes. The pity that this official release inspires only worsens with the news that the tribe, in a final attempt to &#8220;be proactive in making the tribe self-sufficient&#8221;, has plans to plan (yes, that is correct) to build a hotel, indoor waterpark and a golf course.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the tribe made this statement: &#8220;Sure, our people living on the reservation are overcrowded. No, many do not have telephone service &#8211; or even Internet access. Yes, our expensive legal team not only drained our funding for much-needed services (like fire protection), but also ensured that no new jobs would come into the reservation. But we are hopeful that the new indoor waterpark will go a long way in achieving true self-sufficiency for the tribe.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Officials work on solution for Elbonia Street bridge</strong><br />
The Elbonia Street bridge has long been a hazard to civilian life traversing Elbonia Street, not to mention the engineers driving the trains that cross it. Drivers of cars and trucks have struck the bridge no less than 14 times in the last four years alone, and while nearly all incidents have been attributed to driver error, the City Counsel still feels a need to do their civic duty to ensure that future strikes may be avoided.</p>
<p>The plan selected for action consists of two I-beams, painted yellow, to be stationed on either side of the road ahead of the bridge and adorned with flashing lights. The flashing pattern has yet to be determined, but one representative stated that he is hoping &#8220;for a message of warning &#8211; maybe in Morse code?&#8221;.</p>
<p>This plan was selected from many proposed at a public hearing several weeks ago, attended by nearly 8 of the general public, several railroad officials and the secretary of the city governor who was in attendance at the premier of <a href=""http://carsthemovie.com"">Cars</a> on a &#8220;fact-finding initiative&#8221;. Other plans included the replacement of the existing bridge with a drawbridge to allow passage for taller vehicles, or the removal of the bridge entirely. The former plan was amended to include I-beams of warning for oncoming trains for occasions when the drawbridge would be up, but no change was suggested for the latter concerning train safety.</p>
<p>Confidence is high in the performance of the warning I-beams. The City Counsel is proceeding carefully, however &#8211; as a spokesperson said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to put more into this than is needed. We are quite set on having yellow flashing lights on our I-beams, and hope that drivers will be able to see them.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Meditation &#8211; Transforming ourselves into being peace</strong><br />
<em>From Cousin Bert at the Ego and Spirituality Center</em><br />
A story is often told about a driver traversing a street and striking a bridge when his vehicle careens out of control. This only leads us to print sorrow and heebie-jeebies in our lives, and even upon the eath on which we tread &#8211; or drive. However, I know that if we all look inside ourselves, we will find that we truely do want to print peace and tranquility wherever we walk &#8211; or drive. We may not be able to change others, unless we hold high positions in government, but with the proper application of self-hypnosis (and perhaps psychiatric care), we can transform ourselves into being peace. Only then will we be able to avoid the inevitable bridges on the streets of life.</p>

During the month of June, state officials are asking all motorists to conserve the declining turtle population. Take a moment, while you are transforming yourself into being peace, and help the turtles. This announcement only effective through June 30.</p>

2006-06-13 19:39:00,Mostly harmless.,"<p>Such is earth, and most of the individuals in it. Although there are a few deserving of careful evaluation &#8211; a point made clearer to me by a website that I just spent two-ish minutes at. Dear me.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about music, shall we? Music is good for you, as a rule. That&#8217;s &#8220;music&#8221;, by the way, not &#8220;semi-tasteless and unimaginative melodies backed by a synth track&#8221;. This does not apply to <a href=""http://royksopp.com"">RÃ¶yksopp</a>, which has wonderful taste. Mostly.</p>
<p>My musical tastes [ stops to skip past a country song that I purchased for my sister ] stroll together happily for a few yards and then stride passionately in separate directions after a difficult feud. My collection is expanding to accomodate my classical music, but the greatest growth is in Gregorian chants. Love those, but there aren&#8217;t enough of them. Pity. On the other colloquial hand is the collection of chick-pop music &#8211; <a href=""http://hilaryduff.com/"">Hillary Duff</a>, <a href=""http://www.mandymoore.com/"">Mandy Moore</a> and <a href=""http://www.natashabedingfield.com/"">Natasha Bedingfield</a> come to mind.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the&#8230; Christian music. I&#8217;d have more of it, but decent Christian music that doesn&#8217;t consist of semi-tasteless and unimaginative melodies backed by synth tracks (or the ones that are just these college guys with guitars and time) is difficult to find. <a href=""http://plumbinfo.com"">Plumb</a> is good (really good), as is <a href=""http://www.davidcrowderband.com/"">David Crowder Band</a> (though their website&#8217;s out of date) and a few others, but&#8230; gah. I own Lifesong (most recent from <a href=""http://www.castingcrowns.com/"">Casting Crowns</a>), which I&#8217;m more ashamed of than anything else. That&#8217;s the album in my collection that I purchased simply because they have the label &#8220;Christian&#8221; and nothing else. Bah. Christian is good &#8211; this is what I identify myself with &#8211; but the music is simply lacking. A lot. I&#8217;m not even going to talk about it. I suppose a lot of it is personal bias, but the lead vocalist needs work, he should <em>not</em> be backed by a single female vocalist if you can hardly hear her (always seems like she&#8217;s at -20Db), the music itself is uninspired (ironic, no?)... Ee. I&#8217;m done.</p>
<p>Anyway. My next chant from Coro de monjes del Monasterio Benedictino de Santo Domingo de Silos has 71% to go. I&#8217;m hungry.</p>

<p>For you and for whoever else who wonders, the time here hasn&#8217;t been bad. Still haven&#8217;t met my roommate (he&#8217;s deposited his belongings in the room; we just haven&#8217;t seen each other yet), but &#8220;The Long, Dark Tea Time of the Soul&#8221; is a phenomenal book. Great stuff, Douglas Adams, as usual.</p>
<p>The seminar speaker this evening was excellent &#8211; a returned Peace Corps volunteer. The audience left a bit to be desired, at least during the q&#38;a session. But then, such is the greater state of&#8230; teenagers. Never liked that word. :)</p>
<p>Mom, turns out that we need a note to get me released from this place. Send a faxed note of permission and such to 262-472-5210 &#8211; they need to know who you are and who I am and when you need to pick me up. And any other relevant (or not) information that you&#8217;d care to bestow upon whoever checks the fax.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll pray for Abbey &#8211; glad that Megan the Lamb is doing well. The hall has a piano room in the basement; I&#8217;ll request the key, methinks. Not the talent show, this time, but I feel very strong need coming on to use a piano.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll never guess who I saw at a Stevens Point gas station with Paul and Alison. No, don&#8217;t &#8211; you won&#8217;t. Actually, you might. Within several guesses. But I&#8217;ll relieve the suspension (for your sake, Ethan) &#8211; Aunt Amy with her kids! &#8220;And to think that I saw [them] [there]...&#8221; &#8211; Doctor Suess</p>
<p>I may call, if I either find a phone or manage to get the copy of linux (that&#8217;s running on the school laptop) to work with the wireless card properly. :) A challenge.</p>
<p>Cheers to you all &#8211; hasta luego.</p>

2006-06-19 02:49:27,The Future,"<p>Not terribly sure how I feel about the future. That&#8217;s not to say that I haven&#8217;t thought about it, but when I generally think of it I get a very strong urge to think about something else and something preferably more pleasant.</p>
<p><a href=""http://davezach.com"">Dave Zach the Futurist</a> delivered the keynote this morning. Subject: &#8220;An Owner&#8217;s Guide to the Future&#8221;. <em>Very</em> good talk, well delivered. I&#8217;m generally suspiscious of those who make their present living from skillfully-delivered keynote speeches, but David knew what he was talking about.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll scan my notes later (like the admitted geek that I am). But the talk, on the whole, rather served to depress (as opposed to variously inspire, uplift or incite a cheerful countenance). Not to be cynical or anything (honest), but the future looks kind of bleak. In America, anyway. ... No, for most of the world.</p>
<p>Think through this, or don&#8217;t if you&#8217;d prefer <a href=""http://www.thefish.com/"">the fish</a>: over time, your relative impact on your immediate environment lessens severely. At birth, you had impact on your parents (and grandparents and siblings, as applicable), and a strong one at that (in all likelyhood). You come of age and walk in the kindergarten room door, and have an impact on your parents (and grandparents and siblings, as applicable), classmates and teacher, but the average effect is less. Welcome to high school &#8211; you, out of several thousand kids, won&#8217;t make any lasting effect on most anyone. Mostly. You enter the workplace: Walmart, for sake of this one-sided argument. You don&#8217;t matter really to anyone, in light of Walmart&#8217;s global scale of employment/service.</p>
<p>This probably doesn&#8217;t bother most people, mostly because it&#8217;s not generally something that people like to think about (see first paragraph). This probably is why those with the widest viewpoint are often manically depressed.</p>
<p>And then God enters the picture (or creates it, rather), and then life gains meaning. It&#8217;s no longer about what impact you have (thank you, God), but about the impact that God will make through you.</p>
<p>And it happens, oddly enough. But I manage to forget this last, all-important facet entirely too often and generally come across as an individual who would much rather just forget his surroundings and do something mindless for a while. Or conquer the world, depending on what day it is. Usually not Tuesday.</p>
<p>Anyway. This is all if you consider the future on a global scale. The future, assuming that we&#8217;re only concerned about your immediate vinicinity or that you&#8217;re exceptionally bright in some obscure area where most people aren&#8217;t exceptionally bright with you, could very easily be very attractive indeed. Look on the bright side. You&#8217;re alive, no?</p>

2006-06-21 02:47:38,Tommy,"<p>Fairly sure of his name&#8230; Tommy&#8217;s my roommate for the week. Interesting guy, interesting background. Interesting intentions for the future &#8211; more from a determination to not repeat the matriarchal past, but he&#8217;d make a good author regardless.</p>
<p>I am profoundly grateful that I was given a roommate that (1) is not one of the dolts who aren&#8217;t here for any reason whatsoever, (2) is not a jock, and (3) is intelligent.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting. He knows more about me than I think most people do, and I get the slight impression that it&#8217;s the same the other way around. The odds that we&#8217;re going to see each other beyond this week are neglible, and perhaps it&#8217;s for this reason that I feel <em>safe</em> talking to him. About the things that I honestly don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve told anyone else.</p>
<p>And the same goes for a few other guys that I&#8217;ve met here. A Canadian, for example (I haven&#8217;t a <em>clue</em> what his name is, but we&#8217;re on a first-name basis anyway) &#8211; being a random guy that I&#8217;ve never seen before who isn&#8217;t likely to move to my hometown makes him much easier to <em>talk</em> to (as opposed to simply exchange light comments with).</p>
<p>The speakers today were incredible. Honestly incredible. I&#8217;ll post the videos as <em>soon</em> as I can &#8211; these are the things that America needs to know. Wow.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>

2006-06-22 20:28:00,Rap,"<p>It&#8217;s not that rap cannot be enjoyed. It has been observed &#8211; though not by reliable witnesses &#8211; that it can in fact be enjoyed in backdoor establishments when accompanied by alcohol, various hallucinogens that most of Great Britain would be shocked to find in existence, and the odd pole-dancer.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the pole-dancer, rap is in good supply. And, for that matter, even if all rappers were to die of unknown causes (most are admittedly known to die of unknown causes in the first place, but for the purposes of this thought experiment we shall assume that they would all be done in at once in as a humanitarian fashion as is reasonable during a particularly raucous Saturday-night party in a backdoor establishment of Chicago), a remarkably decent replacement can be served up by any knowledgable Mac user with a few minutes in GarageBand 3 (Â£40 in most surplus stores) and a noticably violent threat to his or her physical wellbeing. Or gotee, should the Mac user be male.<br />

2006-06-25 03:12:00,World Affairs Seminar,"<p>Wow. What a week.</p>

<p>The previous sentence is meant to be read slowly, with large pauses placed between each word for emphasis of the disjoint words themselves. As in, &#8220;What &#8230; a &#8230; week.&#8221; The proper response, if read correctly, is &#8220;Wooah.&#8221;</p>

<p>Topics: Everything under the sun &#8211; persecution, roles of corporations in a globalized society, military, environmentalism&#8230;</p>

<p>Atmosphere: intellectual, but still enjoyable. Really enjoyable.</p>

<p>Participants: Excellent speakers. The students were split: some the &#8220;Badger Boys/Girls State rejects&#8221; who were there by default, and others were there to be there.</p>

<p>Food: Good enough.</p>

<p>I came with a bit of aprehension: what on earth is a week listening to speakers going to be like, and what on earth am I going to do between eating, sleeping and listening?</p>

<p>Fortunately and thankfully, two things were introduced that answered the question to the extreme. Like asking your parents for college money and then having your lawyer call and inform you that someone in Vermont created a savings trust for your education 400 years ago and the balance is now in excess of 250,000 <span class=""caps"">USD</span>.</p>

<p>First: an air-conditioned computer lab. The air-conditioning is important, because the temperature in there was somewhat cooler than everywhere else. The latter is also significant: I brought a laptop from school, expecting there to be (1) a wireless network and (2) an excess of time to burn. Neither of these readily presented themselves, and the network admin at school locked the beast down waay too tightly for me to even use the wireless card that I had for it.</p>

<p>Second: several Canadians, and Tommy. And Diane. And Vince. And Ellen. And Gram-ham and Eli.</p>

<p>The Canadians presented themselves in the forms of Riley Maggs, Jaremy Edigar and Graham the Unknown, called such because no one really knows his last name. Riley went on to become one of my closest friends in the span of 4-5 days (which either means that all of my pre-existing friendships must have been rather shallow or that a minor miracle occured), Jaremy showed me that, yes, humanity can be incredibly vulgar but still be decent, and Graham was called Gram-ham repeatedly by one of our very Spanish-speaking counselors. &#8220;Gram-ham?&#8221; And it was a quick &#8220;Gram-ham&#8221;, pronounced like one would in a Spanish locale, not as if one were in Georgia.</p>

<p>Tommy was my roommate. Wonderful guy: intellectual, very human, not overly geeky but not at all a jock, and with a wonderfully European nose. I miss him.</p>

<p>Diane. Diane Diane Diane. Diane is from Appleton, which happens to be 3 hours and 28 minutes from Rhinelander. Delightful girl. We spent a bit of time strolling the campus after a sub-par dance, talking over life, the universe and everything.</p>

<p>Vince: Vince is just cool. You look at him and thing, &#8220;Geeah, that guy&#8217;s cool.&#8221; We think that he has a house in Mexico, and will hold our reunion there.</p>

<p>Ellen: Reminds me very strongly of <a href=""http://ipa.buffalostate.edu/~paula/"">Paula Darmsteader</a> and Karen Clark, for the hair and face/personality, respectively. Christian girl who loves techno and <a href=""http://www.thejulianatheory.com"">The Juliana Theory</a>. Perfect.</p>

<p>Eli: One of the 6th floor counselors, with a tendency to wear white sunglasses, much like <a href=""http://media.midiringtones.com/media/graphics/thumbnails/color120x80/26218.jpg"">these</a>, in conjunction with slightly tattered khaki shorts that likely were not shorts in a previous and more affluent life, but are enjoying a much more enjoyable lifestyle in the present. He has a dual citizenship in Canada, which explains why he&#8217;s so cool. Which reminds me: someone owes me $5 from pizza on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>Gah, I miss everyone. Riley put it this way in a conversation earlier today online:</p>

<p>remember the little speech that was given on meeting new people?<br />
&#8220;somewhere in this crowd is someone who if you meet and converse with, both of your lives will be changed immeasurably for the better&#8221;<br />
I dunno about you man, but I think that the group we had going on<br />
was pretty d*** successful</p>

2006-06-26 02:54:00,MusiGenesis,"<p>In light of the closing dance at the World Affairs Seminar, I made a vow to mix a rap album as soon as I arrived home, just to prove that there&#8217;s really nothing to it.</p>
<p>So I stumbled upon <a href=""http://www.musigenesis.com/"">MusiGenesis</a>, which does prove my point about &#8220;anyone [being able to] create great-sounding music using only a personal computer&#8221;, but is developed on an interesting concept: the music is &#8220;grown&#8221;.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll have to try it. Really. The thing&#8217;s entirely free for forever, unless you want to save or export. Then it&#8217;s $19.95, which I&#8217;m considering paying.</p>

PO Box 458<br />
Rhinelander, WI 54501</p>
<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.pacificcoast.net/~ttruscott/"">Ted Truscott</a>, the esteemed instructor of cane defense for seniors, once <a href=""http://www.lwcbooks.com/articles/traditionarticle.html"">said this</a>:</p>
<p><em>Tradition really does have the value of keeping us centered and safe in many situations and frees us from having to repeat the mistakes of the past. ... It is the pressure of the wind, new fads and ideas, held back by tradition, that allows the kite to soar.</em></p>
<p>It can&#8217;t really be said any better than this, so I offer this quote to you as a thanks for your adherence to tradition.</p>
<p>Like those who preceded you in ownership of the camp (it was at that time called Algonquin), you have fearlessly made use the public address system, fondly maintaining it and restoring its wiring when a speaker goes down.</p>
<p>Never mind, of course, that the other 20 households on the lake wish to spend their evenings without being subject to your announcements and tasteful selections of new age and dance music &#8211; bending to their desire of quiet would show you to be like a weak kite, unable to stand up to the &#8220;pressure of the&#8230; new fads and ideas&#8221;, in the immortal words of Truscott.</p>
<p>So carry on in your journey. Continue to delight the children and adolescents who come to stay in your newly-built cabins, and play with wild abandon on your tennis courts and in-ground trampolines. Perhaps, one day, you will even add horses to your offering and so fufill the name &#8220;Camp Horseshoe&#8221;.</p>
<p>But in all of this, remember the tradition of the public address system.  Even if the families on the shores of the lake that we all share only want peace and quiet, I share your confidence that it is the tradition that matters &#8211; continuing to share your music and sporting events at a volume that allows the sound to travel for miles outside of the camp&#8217;s borders may actually be best for their health. A healthy dose of well-chosen music, according to <a href=""http://www.heartmath.org/research/research-papers/HZandIgA/index.html"">recent studies</a>, may after all be beneficial to one&#8217;s salivary system.</p>
<p>Carry on, Camp Horseshoe. Hold to tradition &#8211; continue on with your PA system and share the Camp Horseshoe experience with everyone within a 5 mile radius.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<li>Things will always work out. Although, that&#8217;s Biblical: &#8220;And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.&#8221; &#8211; Romans 8:28.

<li>I <em>love</em> it when people make good use of the resources that I give them. <a href=""http://freetxp.com"">FreeTXP</a>, baby.</li>
<li>&#8220;I&#8217;ll call you&#8221; really means &#8220;Well&#8230; this conversation is getting kind of awkward, so let&#8217;s do this: if something reminds me of you during the week when I happen to have my hand on the phone and I can remember your phone number &#8211; no, don&#8217;t bother; I think I have it somewhere &#8211; I might give you a call. Depends on how hungry I&#8217;ll be.&#8221; This I know from shameful experience.</li>
<li>Life goes on.</li>
</ol>

<p>Google has celebrated the 4th again this year, and their holiday logo from this year contrasted with last year&#8217;s (they&#8217;re both there on the left) brings this to mind: &#8220;Mindless flag-waving is not patriotism: it is a form of hysteria.&#8221; A couple of you will recall this &#8211; Dan Maguire cited it.

<p>This is going to be one of those entries where I talk about what I did today. If you don&#8217;t like those or would rather read something else in the vast array of blogs, go there now. This could be boring. Oh, wait &#8211; the brownies are done.</p>
<p>Not quite. The toothpick still garners brownie residue.</p>
<p>Woke up almost exactly 30 minutes past my alarm clock (thanks, Mom). I&#8217;ve discovered that I&#8217;m much more comfortable when I sleep in pants, interestingly enough. That&#8217;s pants versus your standard pajama-style pants.</p>
<p>Skipped breakfast (I know, bad for you) and stopped by Metro Screen Printing on my way to work. They&#8217;ll sell their blank shirts for $5, and as they&#8217;re the only shirts that really fit me (honestly, no one sells clothing for people who aren&#8217;t semi-obese). Bought two ($10.13-ish) and picked up a latte from Magic Jo. Double shot, iced 2%, with rum. It&#8217;s a scaled down of my usual (double iced, breve [half&#38;half], 1.5 shots rum, .5 shots javalua), but (the brownies are still not done) it&#8217;s considerably less expensive. And this I like.</p>
<p>Work went well, as usual. Found six-ish optical mice in the basement, along with the double 15&#8221; LCD display that I found yesterday. The things you find&#8230;</p>
<p>The work day ended a half-hour later; the tape drive that the server uses for backup was being finicky. I won.</p>
<p>JC <del>Pennies</del> Penny&#8217;s being open until 9 tonight (future reference: they close at 5 on holidays like the 4th), I stopped to pick up a couple ties and a shirt. I saved $30-something, and discovered that you cannot apply for a Penny&#8217;s card until you are 18. Blast.</p>

<li>I&#8217;m easily distracted. If it&#8217;s new and shiny, I&#8217;m there.</li>
<li>I also have ideas. Things that I&#8217;d <em>love</em> to do, and hey &#8211; why not?</li>
</ol>
<p>These two things combined make for very little productivity on the initiatives that I begin on my own. I&#8217;ve got&#8230; what, Prospork, Gradflag, SuperBucket, CLASSYgeek&#8230; Four entirely seperate projects that could each do very well. But what to work on? Prospork is relatively stable, Gradflag is little more than a concept, SuperBucket is halfway complete, CLASSYgeek has been started and restarted more times than I care to count. Blast.</p>
<p>Right, I&#8217;m going to lay them all out on the table. Now.</p>
<p><strong>Gradflag</strong>
<ul>
<li>Service: customizable/extensible online grad announcements/invitations, RSVP functionality</li>
<li>Target market: seniors in HS/college</li>
<li>Notes: should this be a paid service, then?</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>SuperBucket</strong>
<ul>
<li>Service: note storage/organization</li>
<li>Target market: scatterbrained individuals who spend a lot of time on a computer</li>
<li>Notes: half-done; working on note organization/retrieval</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>CLASSYgeek</strong>
<ul>
<li>Service: news, a community, merchandise</li>
<li>Target market: geeks who are do not fit the geek stereotype &#8211; out of touch with reality, failing personal hygiene, etc. &#8211; <em>classy</em> geeks</li>
<li>Notes: should this be for tech geeks alone, or expanded for art, music, science, etc? Powered by Textpattern, Drupal&#8230;?</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Bah. I really want to see all three go somewhere. For whoever&#8217;s reading this &#8211; if you have any experience in web dev and have been taken by any of the three concepts presented above, let me know.</p>

</ol>

<p>Just like <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/2006/06/02/thoroughly-disillusioned"">the last one</a>, this is a phenomenally <em>bad</em> piece of advertising. Interestingly, the number under the little scratcher matched the number printed above it. Then again, there is absolutely no indication that either number was printed especially <em>for</em> my copy of the mailing. Usually something like that would be done seperately with a dot-matrix mass printer or something. The barcode too.</p>

<p>But then, this is something from &#8220;Commercial Solicitation&#8221;. The street address actually matches up to the Baerresen Group, Inc (here&#8217;s <a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?q=3283+Trade+Center+Dr,+92507&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=33.983198,-117.346199&amp;spn=0.003158,0.006781&amp;t=k&amp;om=1"">a satellite pic of their building</a>), the <span class=""caps"">VPO</span> of which declares himself to be 84% punk rock on his Myspace (he has 30 friends). These are the guys who brought you <a href=""http://www.tkevents.com/"">Turn-Key Events</a>, which you can call at 1-866-<span class=""caps"">GROSS</span>-4-U. No, I&#8217;m serious.</p>

<p>[ sigh ] If anyone from Sedlak (or the Baerresen Group) reads this, know that you <em>can</em> do better. <em>I</em> believe in you. Honest.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong><br />
Upon closer inspection, it turns out that there&#8217;s no problem in having all of the mailings have winning scratcher thingers.</p>

<p>The fine print says this (among other things):</p>

<p><em>Valid for first winning number. &#8230; Odds of winning grand prize $2,500 Wal-Mart Gift Card are 1:70,078. Odds of winning $5 Wal-Mart Gift Card area 70,077:70,078. Grand Prize will be awarded if winning number is presented during dates and times listed only.</em></p>

<p>And there you are. Assuming that all 70,078 recipients of this mailing are present, one will win the advertised $2,500 card. The rest, save the one lucky one, will get $5 cards. Not bad, I suppose.  That&#8217;ll pay for the gas to pick up the card, anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Final thought</strong><br />
&#8220;No gimmicks&#8221;, it says. No gimmicks. So the scratcher is&#8230;?</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv
2006-07-17 04:35:44,"""VoipBuster beats the Skype offer!""","<p>I&#8217;m not sure how they&#8217;re <em>beating</em> it, but <a href=""http://voipbuster.com"">VoipBuster</a> is also now offering free calling in the US. Not Canada, though, so I don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;s beating Skype&#8230;</p>
<p>Though VoipBuster does have a couple cool features that <a href=""http://skype.com"">Skype</a> does not, namely text messaging and (my favorite) connecting any landline/cell phone to any other landline/cell phone, using your VB credit. And with free calling in the US, it&#8217;s like free long distance. Nice.</p>
<p>Works like this: you give VoipBuster the number of whatever phone you&#8217;re closest to (e.g. 1XXXxxxXXXX) and the phone number that you want to call. International format, remember, so the 1 in front is necessary. Hit the appropriate button, and your home phone rings. Pick it up, and you&#8217;ll be connected to the other phone number. It&#8217;ll ring, and you&#8217;re free to talk for&#8230; hm. Forever? I&#8217;m not sure if there&#8217;s a limit.</p>

2006-07-27 04:02:00,Life and Music and Automated Ad Farms,"<p><strong>Life</strong><br />
is good. Steady and engaging job, decent work on the side, friends here and there to variously hang out or talk online for hours with.</p>
<p><strong>Music</strong><br />
is lacking, unfortunately. I miss Calah. I did put music to one of her lyric sets, though, and a writing a song. You might remember the audio concept posted earlier &#8211; Stay With Me? Yeah, it&#8217;s branching off of that. And speaking of audio concepts, here&#8217;s a breakbeat loop for you to play with: <txp:file_download_link id=""14""><txp:file_download_name /></txp:file_download_link>.</p>
<p><strong>Automated Ad Farms</strong><br />
While looking for the site referred to by the <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9079962398013227200&#38;q=Chronic+of+Narnia"">Lazy Sunday / Chronic of Narnia video</a>, I ran into <a href=""http://skoop.com"">skoop.com</a>, an unusually tasteful example of an automated ad farm. It&#8217;s another ad directory site (you&#8217;d think <a href=""http://overture"">Overture</a> would have caught on by now), but it doesn&#8217;t look ugly (<a href=""http://domainsponsor.com/"">DomainSponsor</a>, you should be ashamed of yourself).</p>
<p>As long as I&#8217;ve mentioned DomainSponsor, let&#8217;s go into a bit more depth. DS is responsible for those strange blue sites that open popups from <a href=""http://revenue.net"">Revenue.net</a> (same group, by the look of the logos). The domains get parked and an iframe points to a URL like <a href=""http://landing.domainsponsor.com/?a_id=208&#38;domainname=referer_detect"">http://landing.domainsponsor.com/?a_id=208&#38;domainname=referer_detect</a>. Interestingly enough, when you go directly to a url like this, the site returned is branded with &#8220;Information.com&#8221;. (Slogan: &#8220;What you need, when you need it.&#8221; That&#8217;s <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=%22What+you+need%2C+when+you+need+it%22"">almost a clichÃ©</a>.) It looks like the landing page pulls the parked domain from the referrer data, and when it doesn&#8217;t have any, it uses information.com as the default.</p>
<p>Which is silly, because <a href=""http://information.com"">information.com</a> doesn&#8217;t point to DomainSponsor. Information.com&#8217;s had a <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://information.com"">long and varied history</a>, posing as <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/19971210191003/http://information.com/"">the future site of Interband communications</a> (they were hiring, and they evidently didn&#8217;t get anyone), <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/19980208165949/http://information.com/"">i2x Media</a> (&#8220;Internet advertising is failing. i2x Media is going to fix it.&#8221; Not with invalid HTML, you&#8217;re not.), and a bland page (well, they&#8217;re all bland) with an empty mailto link (which did get fixed on Feb 29, 2000). It was hijacked momentarily by John Somebody (affiliated with <a href=""http://www.girosol.com/;"">Girosol</a> they should never have been given a copy of Flash). May of 2003 is when the domain first appeared to have succumbed to immoral search/content advertising bots, in whose hands it then stayed for some time.</p>
<p>When it became a legit-looking search site, we shall never know. At least whoever&#8217;s in control of it now tried to make it look good &#8211; it really is an ad farm after all.</p>
<p>[ two minutes later ]<br />
The site actually does turn out to be the property of <a href=""http://oversee.net"">Oversee.net</a>, the guys behind DomainSponsor .com and Revenue.net. I guess they do the same kind of thing with sites like <a href=""http://degrees.com"">degrees.com</a>, <a href=""http://low.com"">low.com</a> and, interestingly enough, <a href=""http://livedigital.com"">LiveDigital</a> which does actually appear to be a site of some use to people other than advertisers.<br />

2006-08-01 04:14:00,Suggestions for your PA system.,"<p>(<a href=""http://ikebowen.com/2006/07/01/traditional-values"">followup</a>)</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Along with 23 other households, I make my home on the lovely shores of Snowden Lake. Beautiful &#8211; you couldn&#8217;t have chosen a better spot to park your camp. The clear waters of the lake complement the grounds, making it the ideal place for a home or summer camp, as it were. Consider yourself fortunate &#8211; with real estate prices on the rise, it&#8217;s lucky for all of us that you got in before the rates became too high.</p>
<p>And you&#8217;ve made excellent use of the property, building on and sometimes over what the previous landowners had established. They would be proud, and especially so if they were told of their public address system that you&#8217;ve extended. At least, I assume you&#8217;ve extended it &#8211; I didn&#8217;t hear is used half so much under the previous owners as I do now.</p>
<p>Not that that&#8217;s a bad thing in the least, for I do enjoy the musical selections that you choose to broadcast. The occasional announcements are a bit of a bother, but as an avid fan of Panic at the Disco, Natasha Bedingfield and the like, I can easily overlook these.</p>
<p>My only problem is that I can&#8217;t quite seem to make out the actual words of the songs that are played. The volume isn&#8217;t a problem at all (I estimate it to be a good 40 decibels from where I am now &#8211; at least half a mile from the lakeside itself), but the clarity of the sound itself isn&#8217;t very good.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d suggest better equipment. You&#8217;ve got the principles of projection down (which reminds me &#8211; I stop by for a closer look; the sound from my living room stereo won&#8217;t reach the upper level of the house), but you might want to add a couple more high-level speakers (maybe a Mackie &#8211; they&#8217;re known for sound accuracy, and the dispersion ratios are incredible) and raise them up a bit. I suspect the trees are muddying the sound, and while you&#8217;ve made it better by removing a portion of them, raising the speakers themselves above the treeline and pointing them at perhaps a -15 degree angle from horizontal would help a great deal. There&#8217;s really no point in listening to a song from Panic and not being able to hear it word for uncensored word, right?</p>
<p>Take this into consideration. Your taste in music is fine, as it the projection level itself, but the clarity leaves a bit to be desired. I&#8217;m sure my neighbours agree, and be assured that we support you in this endeavour.</p>
<p>And hey, if better equipment won&#8217;t fit in your budget, just turn it up. Do us all a favor.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Isaac Bowen</p>
<p>P.S. Idea! Adding a few subwoofers wouldn&#8217;t hurt &#8211; water carries bass like you wouldn&#8217;t believe.<br />
P.P.S. And the new-age-ish selections played during the evening are excellent. Sound clarity isn&#8217;t a problem there; flute music was meant to be heard through miles of trees.</p>

<em>9:13:45 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> Hi Isaac.  <br />
<em>9:14:18 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> Hello.</p>
<p><em>9:14:35 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> ck if there&#8217;s an option for monitor on the XPS 200,. hold on please.  <br />
<em>9:15:40 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> I&#8217;m looking at the monitor selection now &#8211; there are selections for several items from the UltraSharp series, but no selection for no monitor at all.  <br />
<em>9:16:10 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> Ok sorry to keep you waiting, i have checked on the XPS 200 and there&#8217;s a &#8220;no monitor&#8221; option on it, just subtract $400 on the starting price.  <br />
<em>9:16:41 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> What do you plan on using this system for?  <br />
<em>9:17:12 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> Home office. I&#8217;m really not seeing a no monitor option.  <br />
<em>9:18:33 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> Ok.  <br />
<em>9:18:51 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> Can i ask if you are under Dell Home and Home office site Isaac?  <br />
<em>9:19:08 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> I am, yes.  <br />
<em>9:19:25 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> Specifically, I&#8217;m looking at the 1st step of customizing the dxps200f3.  <br />
<em>9:19:46 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> Ok can i ask the price of the XPS 200 that you are looking at?  <br />
<em>9:19:54 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> Currently? $2056.  <br />
<em>9:20:16 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> Can i a ask the starting price please?  <br />
<em>9:20:56 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> $1190  <br />
<em>9:21:25 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> Ok let me try to check again. Hole on please.  <br />
<em>9:21:50 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> Actually, no &#8211; it starts at $1657.  <br />
<em>9:22:05 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> Ok i have seen the XPS 200, and there&#8217;s a &#8220;no monitor&#8221; on the Monitor option.<br />
<em>9:22:06 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> I&#8217;m customizing the &#8220;Productivity&#8221; version.  <br />
<em>9:23:49 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> Let me paste in what I see.  <br />
<em>9:24:00 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> Ok.  <br />
<em>9:24:13 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> Let me check on that particular configuration.<br />
<em>9:24:17 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> Monitors</p>
<p>20 inch UltraSharpâ„¢ 2007FPW Widescreen Digital Flat Panel [Included in Price]<br />
20 inch Ultrasharpâ„¢ 2007FP Digital Flat Panel [add $50 or $1/month1]<br />
24 inch UltraSharpâ„¢ 2407FPW Widescreen Digital Flat Panel [add $410 or $12/month1]  <br />
<em>9:24:29 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> i see, sorry to keep you waiting.  <br />
<em>9:25:29 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> i have seen the XPS 200 that you are looking at, and there&#8217;s no &#8221; no monitor&#8221; option on it, why not choose the one costs at $1190, it has the monitor option on it, just subtract $400.  <br />
<em>9:26:09 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> Because the only OS option for /that/ model is Media Center.  <br />
<em>9:26:13 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> I need XP Pro.  <br />
<em>9:26:28 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> Ok i see, let me try to check on other configuration, hold on please.  <br />
<em>9:27:44 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> Thank you.  <br />
<em>9:27:57 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> Welcome. BTW will you also use this for digital photos, downloading music &#38; burning CD&#8217;s, watching DVD&#8217;s, video editing, games?  <br />
<em>9:28:28 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> Likely, but I still do not want Media Center.  <br />
<em>9:28:50 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> Ok i see, so are you concerned about the size of the desktop that you are looking ?  <br />
_9:2_9:19 AM_ <strong>You</strong> I&#8217;d prefer the smaller chassis.  <br />
<em>9:30:27 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> Ok i see, sorry but we do not have the option on the XP pro on other configuration of the XPS 200, how about get the 20 &#8221; monitor then sell it on Ebay or to a friend, you can earn $ also in doing so.  <br />
<em>9:31:02 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> So there&#8217;s honestly no way that you can get me this machine without a monitor.  <br />
<em>9:31:41 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> Yes.  <br />
<em>9:31:50 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> That&#8217;s rediculous.  <br />
<em>9:32:05 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> Why not sell it after wards, also Dell monitors cost more when you sell it, specially in brand new.  <br />
<em>9:32:43 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> Really sorry but what you can see online, is what you can get, we rely on the options as well on the online site.  <br />
<em>9:33:34 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> Though it does seem strange that what I see does not include an option for ordering without a monitor.  <br />
<em>9:33:49 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> It&#8217;s like&#8230; Dell is saying, buy this monitor with this machine, or don&#8217;t buy the machine at all.  <br />
<em>9:33:56 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> Now /there&#8217;s/ a good business practice for you.  <br />
<em>9:34:11 AM</em> <strong>CU_Rep_Christopher_G</strong> Ok i see, i understand Isaac.<br />
<em>9:34:16 AM</em> <strong>You</strong> Thank you for your time. Have a perfectly wonderful day.  <br />

<p>Great concept, one that MusicMatch already actively uses with its &#8220;My Matches&#8221; service. Pandora takes a style/artist/song and plays similar music. When asked to play Rob-Thomas-esque material, Pandora responded with the following:</p>
<img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/118.jpg"" />
<p>Lovin&#8217; those angry lyrics and repetitive chorus. Score.</p>
<p>Predictably enough, Pandora returned <a href=""http://www.pandora.com/music/song/04df0e95c90ad06d"" title=""Pull Defibrilator Mix"">This Is How A Heart Breaks</a>, a really excellent remix of one of Thomas&#8217;s more well-known pieces. Good song, great remix. Though I&#8217;ve got to admit, I&#8217;m partial to electronic mixes anyway. Speaking of which&#8230;</p>
<img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/119.jpg"" />
<p>Trippy soundscapes. Niiiiice. Wow, I&#8217;m impressed. Firstly, because it includes a registration feature within the swf object (sum effect of which is that I could keep listening to the music and register at the same time &#8211; rare for a browser-based service), secondly because it very accurately picked up on what I liked. ... Possibly because I gave it a decent example of what I liked, but hey.</p>
<p>This strikes me as something that Google might do. They&#8217;re watching what people do with their services, observing and tracking the correlations between user actions. I wouldn&#8217;t be a bit suprised if Google takes over / joins this project. Helping predict human patterns would definitely help them when they take over the world.</p>
<p>Oh. Well, Pandora just started playing &#8220;Problem Girl&#8221;. Yep, that&#8217;s Rob Thomas. Ah well.</p>

My feedreader tells me that Google was <a href=""http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6109823.html?part=rss&#38;tag=feed&#38;subj=zdnn"">planning on releasing Apps for Your Domain</a> as of yesterday.</p>
<p>Suprise, <a href=""http://www.google.com/a/?utm_medium=et&#38;utm_source=bizsols&#38;utm_campaign=gafydC"">they have</a>. Tucked into a corner of their business services page, Google is making available Gmail, Calendar, Talk and Pages for any domain that you so desire. The beta&#8217;s available now &#8211; doesn&#8217;t look like there&#8217;s any waiting to be &#8220;approved&#8221; like there was with the original Gmail for Your Domain.</p>
<p>So. I&#8217;m toying with setting it up for <a href=""http://hq52.com"">hq52</a>, but it occured to me that these services would do a fair job serving the business that I&#8217;m employed by. We already own a domain for use, but I checked on <a href=""http://thg.org"">thg.org</a> just in case &#8211; it&#8217;s an appropriate domain for the business, right, and it&#8217;s short. Turns out it&#8217;s a parked adfarm. Right click -> this frame -> page info reveals that it&#8217;s parked at oingo.com.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/2006/07/27/life-and-music-and-automated-ad-farms"">said my bit</a> about ad farm providers. Visiting oingo.com results in a redirect to <a href=""http://appliedsemantics.com"">appliedsemantics.com</a>. Suprise: Applied Semantics has been aquired by Google. A large part of that, likely, went into the development of AdSense. But guess what else they do. <a href=""http://www.google.com/domainpark/"">Domain parking!</a></p>
<p>Google. Makes sense, I suppose. Their AdSense services are second-to-none, like everything else Google does. But I have two problems with their aquisition:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s an aquisition. Google has a history of these, worthy of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Acquisitions_by_Google"">its own Wikipedia entry</a>.  Pyra Labs (turned into Blogger), Picasa (photos), Keyhole (Google Earth), Urchin (Google Analytics), Writely (web-based word processing), Sketchup (3d modeling)... The Applied Semantics aquisition was way back in April of 2003, but I&#8217;m still freaking out about it. One more in the long list of companies and projects that are now under the Google umbrella. If you can&#8217;t (or don&#8217;t feel like) beating them, buy them.</li>
<li><em>Google</em> is behind those flipping ad farms. <em>Google!</em></li>

What?,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/123.gif"" /></p>	<p>I&#8217;ve fantasized for months about a service that would let me buy play-all rights to any song and then store it for me online. I&#8217;d have access to my library from anywhere.</p>
<p>Enter MusicMatch &#8211; or not. I&#8217;ve inadvertently purchased a one-year subscription from them (signed up for the trial, canceled a bit too late), granting me streaming access to their library. It&#8217;s a step up from <a href=""http://xmradio.com"">XM Online</a>, but&#8230; Unfortunately, while they <em>know</em> of all the artists that I&#8217;m looking for, they don&#8217;t have <em>music</em> from all of them (<a href=""http://www.pandora.com/music/artist/ac6c6d3afb5abcbd"">ATB</a>, for example). Pity.</p>
<p>But wait &#8211; what&#8217;s this, patiently waiting for my attention in my feedreader? <a href=""http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6111390.html?part=rss&#38;tag=feed&#38;subj=zdnn"">Something about MP3tunes?</a></p>
<p>Turns out that MP3tunes (from the guy who brought you <a href=""http://mp3.com"">MP3.com</a> and <a href=""http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5191333.html?tag=nl""><del>Lindows</del> Linspire</a>) does nearly exactly what I&#8217;m looking for &#8211; the only difference being that you upload your own music to your &#8220;Oboe Locker&#8221; (I&#8217;m suspecting that&#8217;s a reference to HS band days gone by) to stream back later.</p>
<p>The news coverage that they&#8217;re getting now is for their addition of a free version of their service &#8211; previously, one actually had to <em>pay</em> for hosting your music on their servers.</p>
<p>This makes the most sense as a short-term marketing stunt. With the proliferation of the iPod, a service like MP3tunes didn&#8217;t stand much chance reaching the people who wanted their music with them without lugging around a desktop (though <a href=""http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/bags/5aa6/"">some do</a>, evidently), but maybe now that it&#8217;s free&#8230;</p>
<p>My guess is that MP3tunes won&#8217;t be terribly mainstream. <a href=""http://spiralfrog"">SpiralFrog</a>, maybe, but not MP3tunes.</p>

Subject: Link Thumbnail</p>
<p>I&#8217;m perusing the docs on <a href=""http://lab.arc90.com/2006/07/link_thumbnail.php"">Link Thumbnail</a> &#8211; a handy little script, but should Girafa &#8211; <em>the source for thumbnail images</em> &#8211; be credited somehow for the images supplied? Their services are, after all, paid-only. And you&#8217;re pulling images from MSNSEARCH&#8217;s account. <em>The image references are to http://msnsearch.srv.girafa.com/srv/i?s=MSNSEARCH&#38;r=[url here].</em> Presumably, if it is indeed the account for MSN Search (now Live search), they can afford to have other people mooching off of their subscription. But is that ethical?</p>
<p>Cheers to you,<br />

2006-09-21 20:41:00,magikidsusa.com,"<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I seem to have received an excellent example of <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/ikebowen.com/tags/spam"">spam-in-print</a>. A flyer, placed beneath one windshield wiper on my car &#8211; an advertisement for magickidsusa.com. This is my chief complaint &#8211; if you cannot garner enough traffic for your website through legit advertising methods (though you do say that you receive &#8220;an &#8216;avalanche of hits&#8217;&#8221;), doling out flyers in parking lots is really not the best way to go.</p>
<p>Also, a few notes for your own security. Perusing your site, it became evident that you&#8217;re simply using an installion of Zen Cart to power your system. Keep in mind that this is free, open source software &#8211; if you&#8217;re at all serious about doing business securely, you may want to switch to something professionally developed.</p>
<p>And along the lines of security &#8211; I do see the flash item from Starfield, telling the world that the website is indeed &#8220;Safe and Secure&#8221;. But what&#8217;s this? The site in question is not &#8220;magickidsusa.com&#8221;, but &#8220;www.magickidsdev.com&#8221;! Might this be the development site? Or is magickidsusa.com simply showing everything in magickidsdev.com, minus the administration panel?</p>
<p>If this is the case, you may want to take further steps to secure your online business. The Zen Cart administration panel cannot be accessed from magickidsusa.com, but it&#8217;s very available at magickidsdev.com.</p>
<p>Good luck to you in your further business ventures.</p>

2006-11-10 05:13:00,Back Online,"<p>What was foretold (several times) and attempted (only slightly less frequently) has now come to pass: ikebowen is back online.</p>
<p>To a degree. Blog, yes. Crazy-web-development-projects, not so much. Which is a pity&#8230; but time&#8217;s limited, see.</p>
<p>So. I performed a quick redesign of the site, and it&#8217;s very much a work in progress. I&#8217;m trying to achieve a balance between the mildly striking and the aesthetic, without actually putting a lot of time into it. :) Colour will arrive, promise.</p>
<p>Developments since I last wrote anything:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href=""http://www.zune.net/"">Zune</a> is coming. Microsoft is trying to go social <em>and</em> <a href=""https://www.zune-arts.net/"">artsy</a>, all at the same time. <a href=""http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/zune/"">Gizmodo&#8217;s</a> had quite a lot to say on the subject: product design, functionality/features&#8230; I&#8217;ve preordered one from Amazon, hoping that either (a) someone will be able to hack a webbrowser onto it or (b) Microsoft eventually takes advantage of the built-in WiFi.</li>
<li><a href=""http://christopher-scott.org/"">Christopher Scott</a> (at <a href=""http://freetxp.com"">FreeTXP</a>) has <a href=""http://christopher-scott.org/blog/how-not-to-steal-a-design"">been</a> <a href=""http://digg.com/design/How_NOT_To_Steal_A_Design"">dugg</a>, and has consequently taken down the FreeTXP service for more than a few hours. :) All credit to him.</li>
<li>Applications are in to <a href=""http://mit.edu"">MIT</a>, <a href=""http://wisc.edu"">UW Mad</a>, <a href=""http://nwc.edu"">Northwestern College</a> and <a href=""http://iit.edu"">IIT</a>. ... Time will tell.
<ul>
<li>On that note, my SATs are over and done with. This merits a larger <em>huzzah</em> than I would usually give it; between the subject tests and the actual four-hour&#8230; well, you&#8217;ve probably taken it yourself, so never mind. But the <a href=""http://conserveschool.org/"">Conserve School</a> was an amazing place to take the thing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Music is back. Two songs on the grill; the (developing) lyrics will probably end up under <a href=""/category/expressions/"">expressions</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>twenty minutes later</strong><br />
&#8216;Tis the trouble with wireless peripherals&#8230; Anyway.</p>
<ul>
<li>Am reading <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray"">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a>, which could arguably be called an extended thought experiment into the human psyche. It&#8217;s a book from last term&#8217;s english course that I never actually finished (time again), but I kept it past term ending to complete on my own time. Oscar Wilde&#8217;s ideas are fascinating, the conflict between intellect and soul personified in Dorian Gray. Very interesting read.</li>
<li>Also reading <a href=""http://www.jeanbolen.com/bk_godseveryman.html"">The Gods in Everyman</a> for Classical World Lit; interesting treatment of the gods as personality &#8216;archetypes&#8217;. Ties in well to my thoughts on Dorian Gray, actually.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so&#8230; bah, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s more, but I haven&#8217;t a clue just now what.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

2006-11-10 07:16:00,Inevitable Goodbye,"<p>Background: this was written&#8230; or no, start over. I tried to write this song some time ago and failed relatively miserably, to which Calah B can attest. The lyrics that are below were written within the space of 30 minutes, entirely unmitigated and entirely unexpected. The song isn&#8217;t about death, per sÃ©, but about the parting in general. Probably brought on in part by the graduation of the class of 2006, a group that I still strongly miss.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>

<p>I once heard a tale of a man who was older,<br />
and no one to hold him close at night.<br />
Only one companion: a child from across the street<br />
who stopped in to talk every now and then.</p>

<p>She reminds him of his youth, and of the days gone by;<br />
recollections of the past he knows he had.<br />
They&#8217;re walking through the park: tuppence for the birds she sees<br />
and their friendship is strong, the old man and a child.</p>

<p><em>But the world keeps on turning, and time is moving on</em><br />
<em>We&#8217;re living this life and we live it for love, even when the rest is gone</em></p>

<p>Look ahead a couple of years: an old man on a hospital bed<br />
a young woman, she&#8217;s kneeling by his side<br />
A rose sits by the table; a photo album full of<br />
memories of the life that they had shared</p>

<p>But the look on the nurse&#8217;s face tells the inconquerable truth &#8211; the old man sighs and his friend searches for these words:</p>

<p>Is this the time for you to go, and is the goodbye I say to you<br />
my friend? Is there anything else I can give?<br />
Is this the time for you to go? And if this is goodbye, I&#8217;ll say it again:<br />
I&#8217;ll mis the time we had to share</p>

<p>[ interlude ]</p>

<p>(now) I&#8217;m sitting alone in the park, thinking of friends I&#8217;ve had<br />
and how I&#8217;ve enjoyed the time I&#8217;ve spent with you<br />
(but) I know it won&#8217;t always be like this: as time moves on<br />
so we must close the door to turn to something new.</p>

<p>(it&#8217;s because) the world keeps on turning, and time is moving on<br />
we&#8217;re living this life and we live it for love even when all else is gone</p>

<p>And when the time comes, I&#8217;ll search your face: what do you feel?<br />
Have we come to our end?<br />
But I look again; thought I saw a tear fall from your eye,<br />
and it&#8217;s time for me to say:</p>

<p>Is this the time for you to go, and is this the goodbye I say to you<br />
my friend? Is there anything else I can give?<br />
Is this the time for you to go? And if this is goodbye, I&#8217;ll say it again:<br />
I&#8217;ll miss the time we had to share.</p>

<p>The world keeps on turning, and time is moving on.<br />
We&#8217;re living this life and we live it for love, &#8216;cause it&#8217;s love that lives on.</p>

2006-11-12 05:48:00,Communicating a State of Being,"<p>I really don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s possible to completely and intentionally communicate what&#8217;s going through one&#8217;s mind, using targeted words. The best way, perhaps, is through&#8230; some other form of expression. To understand what someone else is thinking, I find that measuring their reactions and impulses serves best.</p>

<p>Simply being around somebody, I suppose, works. And perhaps I&#8217;m only stating the obvious here, but I think that it&#8217;d be more effective to talk about something <em>other</em> than your state of being than to try to describe it. Observing the subconscious react gives me a much clearer picture than your consciousness trying to describe itself.</p>

<p>Music fits into this, yes? Poetry, visual arts&#8230; Creative efforts stem from what I generally call the soul (versus the mind), and what&#8217;s in the soul is thereby communicated in a form that isn&#8217;t confined to a language. Music has structure, yes, as does a painting. But the soul is more free to express itself in a medium where it&#8217;s not confined to a certain vocabulary.</p>

<p>Sing to me. Play for me. Or talk about the weather &#8211; whatever. There&#8217;s a place for defining your state of being, yes. Getting your thoughts out on paper makes life that much more&#8230; approachable. Treatable. But if you&#8217;re simply trying to <em>show</em> me your soul, don&#8217;t talk about it. Let it show itself.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv
2006-11-12 20:04:00,God and Time,"<p><em>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</em> Genesis 1:1 (<span class=""caps"">NASB</span>)</p>

<p><strong>Did God create time, after all?</strong> The popular belief is that God created <em>everything</em>, but a definition of &#8216;everything&#8217; isn&#8217;t really in place. Life, the universe, and everything, sure. But does time count?</p>

<p>To start with, let&#8217;s get a definition of time out on the table. For the purpose of this thought experiment, I&#8217;m considering time as the fourth dimension &#8211; one up from the third.</p>

<p>And as long as I&#8217;ve brought up the dimensions, let me cover those. The first dimension is a point. No movement possible. The second is a plane &#8211; two dimensions of movement possible, and thus one can move in the second dimension (the X axis, for example) and remain motionless in the first. The third dimension is space &#8211; three dimensions of movement possible, and thus one can move in the third dimension (Z) while remaining motionless in the first two.</p>

<p>The fourth dimension is generally considered to be time, as it&#8217;s logically the only way one can move while remaining motionless in the first three dimensions. If I stand absolutely still, I can still move through time. &#8230; I can really only move forward, granted, but the point stands.</p>

<p>Physical humanity exists, as far as can really be proven, in the fourth dimension. Not only in the fourth dimension, obviously; existence in the <em>x</em> dimension precludes the existence of all dimensions lesser than <em>x</em>. Does that make sense? If a ball is suspended in the air at eye level (not sure how; it just is), its distance from me forms one dimension, its height off the ground is another, and its distance from you might pinpoint the last.</p>

<p><strong>So, with all that in mind,</strong> what dimension does God exist in? It&#8217;s really impossible to know, seeing as how&#8230; well, what&#8217;s the fifth dimension? Yeah, I don&#8217;t know either. :) It&#8217;s safe to say that God exists beyond the fourth. As physical humanity can move at will through all dimensions lesser than its highest (the fourth; we can move through the first three), and God can move through time at will, He therefore should (must?) exist at some dimension higher than we do.</p>

<p>Given this and the earlier conclusion that presence in one dimension mandates the existence of all lower dimensions, the existence of God requires that all lower dimensions, <em>including time</em>, must exist.</p>

<p><strong>So, the question stands: did God create time after all?</strong> As He existed, so time must have existed with Him. Biblically, He created the earth and really everything outside of the earth (&#8220;the heavens&#8221;). Granted, the lack of any reference to time doesn&#8217;t mean that God <em>didn&#8217;t</em> create it, so this whole thought process may be relatively futile. How can we know the mind of an infinite God? To limit Him to what we know of Him would be foolish.</p>

<p>But still, it&#8217;s interesting to mull over.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv
2006-11-14 05:45:00,Pensive and Nostalgic,"<p>I&#8217;m feeling a bit&#8230; wary. Cautious. Slightly unsure.</p>
<p>For a Monday, though, things have gone exceedingly well. Nothing terribly productive to do at work today, the Student Council meeting went decently, Decathlon is ever a good time, and ballroom&#8230; well, ballroom went decently too. I swear, we&#8217;ll get the hang of it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never liked Mondays. Really never liked them, and I suppose I&#8217;m one out of&#8230; the rest of humanity in that opinion. Having to break from a routine that&#8217;s just been settled into is not ideal. You get up at 6:20am five days in a row, then sleep in a day, get up the next at 7:30, and then start again at 6:20. It&#8217;s an aberration, albeit a planned one, in schedule.</p>
<p>Anyway. Aaron got back this evening from his first-ever conference. Yes, there are multiple-day leadership retreats for junior high students. :) He&#8217;s an interesting character, that one. Feels deeply, he does. Generally takes him&#8230; a good 12 hours to fully deflate from an extended event like that.</p>

2006-11-15 06:04:00,Change,"<p>Change is good, yes. People are always interested in change &#8211; trends, fashion, gossip&#8230; The National Inquirer makes its living speculating on change purely for change&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>But&#8230; gah. This is going to be one of those blog entries where the blogger in question appears to be completely self-centered and self-pitying. Apologies; skip this one.</p>
<p>Change. Implies uncertainty of the future and an end to the present. Which, yeah, can be a good thing, and arguably is always a good thing. Not being rooted in the past/present lets you be malleable, flexible, ready to adapt. &#8220;Change is the only constant in life&#8221; &#8211; said by someone at McDonalds, probably, who was overheard and misquoted in a later conversation completely unrelated to the original context. But it&#8217;s generally the truth, and&#8230; I don&#8217;t think I like it. I don&#8217;t handle uncertainty well, and change tears apart situations that have begun to be comfortable.</p>
<p>I guess&#8230; bah. I&#8217;m tired, lonely and unsure. It&#8217;s times like this where I take a slightly displaced view of my own situation &#8211; a 17-yr-old in rural Wisconsin, trying to ignore the little voice that&#8217;s telling him to do his homework. Now. One kid in a million with his own internal conflicts, one side of himself unable to reconcile itself with the other. Does it matter? Probably not &#8211; everyone has emotions, everyone goes through emotional turbulence. This age bracket is known for it. It&#8217;s predictable, it&#8217;s usual. ...

2006-11-17 18:51:00,Death,"<p>I left Rob&#8217;s house and took the first wrong turn possible. Made it back to Rhinelander without further mishap and got on to Cty C on the other side of town. Didn&#8217;t notice any fire on the way back; the housefire from my trip out must have been taken care of.</p>
<p>Pulled around the corner to where our turnoff is. There was a barricade of police cars, an ambulance. It didn&#8217;t really register. I turned around and took the back way in, then realized: there&#8217;s an ambulance. Outside my driveway. ... My sister&#8230; when does she get off from work tonight? My dad and Ethan &#8211; did they come home from the hunter&#8217;s banquet? ... Oh God&#8230; ...</p>
<p>The speed limit on the backroads is 5mph. Even 25mph felt like&#8230; something. It was a possibility, and my mind flashed through the reactions of my siblings. What would they do &#8211; what would their live <em>be</em> like if a brother, sister or parent was gone?</p>
<p>Made it home, pulled up next to the garage. The truck was back; Hannah was home from work. Not the Intrepid though.</p>
<p>Hi Mom. Yeah, what&#8217;s going on? Do you know when Dad&#8217;s planning to get back? Not for a while, then.</p>

Yeah, <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2006/11/15/zune-review/"">Engadget</a> doesn&#8217;t think much of it, but for MS&#8217;s first entry into the market, it&#8217;s not half bad. I&#8217;d only change the sensitivity of the control pad, but that&#8217;s me. Radio/audio/video all work perfectly. Haven&#8217;t had a chance to play with the wireless stuff, but it doesn&#8217;t do much yet anyway. Here&#8217;s hoping that MS makes the most of that hardware in future firmware releases.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m ripping my copy of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360717/"">King Kong</a> to put on it. The rip process itself isn&#8217;t bad (<a href=""http://www.doom9.org/Soft21/Rippers/SetupDVDDecrypter_3.5.4.0.exe""><span class=""caps"">DVD</span> Decrypter</a>), but the recoding into a resized mpg (<a href=""http://www.videora.com/en-us/Converter/iPod/"">Videora iPod Converter</a>) takes forever. &#8220;Forever&#8221;, in this case, being 4-5 hours.</p>

<p>In related news&#8230; <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317219/"">Cars</a> isn&#8217;t half bad either. Three of the family are watching it (again) now. There&#8217;s a <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0317219/Guido.jpg.html"">little Italian forklift</a> in there that reminds me very strongly of Jacque from Finding Nemo. My favorite character by far.</p>

<p>I woke up at 5:30 this morning, unintentionally. That kinda sucked. Was really confused for a few minutes; it wasn&#8217;t light enough to be morning quiet yet, but it wasn&#8217;t dark enough for night&#8230; yeah, anyway.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mundanity&#8217; reminds me of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogon#Vogons"">&#8216;Voganity&#8217;</a>, which reminds me of Douglas Adams. I ordered Antigo&#8217;s copy of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Long-Dark-Tea-Time-Soul/dp/0671742515"">The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul</a>... hopefully it&#8217;ll come in sometime soon.</p>

<p>Scott Adams wrote a book: God&#8217;s Debris. He released a free <span class=""caps"">PDF</span> of it <a href=""http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2005/11/free_ebook_of_g.html"">online</a>. Still haven&#8217;t gotten around to finishing it.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>P.S. Somone managed to get a full-length rip of <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=720927334558326792"">Cars</a> online at Google Video. ... Wow. Google, that&#8217;s a <em>real</em> credit to ya.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv
2006-11-21 04:21:15,Monday Monday,"<p>It&#8217;s remarkable how really <em>mundane</em> everything is. You don&#8217;t even notice it after a while.</p>

<p>Monday proceeded in general as usual. ... But I don&#8217;t really feel like writing about my life, nor do you likely feel inclined to avidly follow it. Pander to the audience.</p>

<p>Hermit crabs are wonderful things. Nearly the ideal pet, I think. Small, fascinating to watch, require little maintenance, and they scuttle. Like dogs, they seem to have mental complexes, only less prone to guilt. Shell envy, restlessness, social&#8230; something. Awareness. Crabs are socially aware.</p>

<p>Giovanni just wandered over by Sebastian and Norgay, who were already sitting next to each other beneath the unpainted ceramic pot fragment. Not sure where Baccus is. I do think it&#8217;s actually spelled &#8220;Bacchus&#8221; (<a href=""http://www.answers.com/baccus"">Baccus</a> seems to be an (aged) jazz organist), but it doesn&#8217;t really matter.</p>

<p>Goldsworthy&#8217;s son is indeed adorable. It&#8217;s curious to me that we find small children so irresistibly endearing. Or most, I suppose. Is it the innocence? Unadulterated youth or the simplicity of mind? Actual size too, I suppose. Rick Moranis taught us <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey,_I_Blew_Up_the_Kid"">that lesson</a>.</p>

<p>The song of the day is <a href=""http://www.pandora.com/music/song/58fac34d864bd145"">Believe In Me</a>, courtesy <a href=""http://www.atb-music.com/"">ATB</a>.</p>

<p>Was finally reunited, after a fashion, with Ben Wohlleber. Life <em>is</em> better with a liberal, hm? Blame Megan.</p>

<p>My desk is a mess again. ... Bah. I&#8217;ll need to clean that before the extended family arrives. And they&#8217;re coming <em>here</em> for Thanksgiving, which might be considered a minor miracle. Or not at all, yeah, but&#8230; wow, that&#8217;s nice. Road trips with seven closely related humans in a car can be stressful, and the desire to get them out of the way (the road trip, not the humans) often cuts short the spend-time-with-long-unseen-relatives.</p>

<p>Hermit crabs also have a strange propensity to climb. I don&#8217;t know why, and I kind of doubt that they do themselves. Giovanni&#8217;s on the climbing wall again; Norgan dismounted the vine tower.</p>

<p>Current mood: scattered and slightly restless. I neeeeeed closure.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv

<p>I love my family. I honestly do &#8211; nuclear and otherwise. Watching the interactions of people who share the same genetic base can be very informative, not to mention entertaining. :)</p>

<p>Anyway, today (more yesterday, actually) featured the Bowen thanksgiving with the entirety of my dad&#8217;s family gracing our humble abode. And it really is a great time &#8211; dad&#8217;s siblings and parents all have very strong and defined personalities, and it&#8217;s shown in their offspring various. I shan&#8217;t go into too many details for fear of offending someone [ grins ], but&#8230; yeah. Glad to have everyone up this year. We&#8217;re planning Christmas for late Dec sometime (surprise).</p>

2006-11-26 01:53:28,The Classifieds,"<p>Right, and I promise I don&#8217;t do this very often, but occasionally there&#8217;s an issue of <del>the</del> one of the local papers that is <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/2006/06/12/the-local-paper"">absolutely ridiculous</a>.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t so much the articles themselves in this issue, but the classifieds. You&#8217;ve got to wonder, do people <em>know</em> how they are presenting themselves?</p>

<p>Some samples, excluding the one about waterfront property on &#8220;gin clear water&#8221;:</p>

<p><strong>HIMALAYAN</strong> Kittens, three 2.5 mos. Old, first shots, $150 each. Call ##.<br />
... Old?</p>

<p><strong>TREADMILL</strong> never used&#8230;<br />
And that was either a gift or a wishful thought.</p>

<p><strong>243 Money To Lend</strong><br />
This category is ridiculous. Spam, the lot of it.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""caps"">HATE</span> TO</strong> shop or just don&#8217;t have the time? I&#8217;ll do it for you.<br />
Oh <em>good</em>.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""caps"">ABRAHAM</span> <span class=""caps"">BASEMENT</span> <span class=""caps"">REPAIR</span>. Specializing in wet, buckled, cracked, sinking basements.</strong> &#8220;When you can&#8217;t get Moses, you can depend on Abraham!&#8221;<br />
Honest.</p>

<p><strong>$13,900 Will put you in the middle of the National Forest</strong><br />
Whereas $15k will send you straight on up to Canada.</p>

<p><strong>530 Hay</strong><br />

<p><strong><span class=""caps"">CHEVY</span> 2001</strong> Prism (same as Toyota Corolla)<br />
Wait, what?</p>

<p>What&#8217;s interesting is the number of ads that seem alarmist. The kind that scream to the world, or to part of it, &#8216;<span class=""caps"">YOUR</span> <span class=""caps"">CREDIT</span> <span class=""caps"">RATING</span> IS <span class=""caps"">BELOW</span> <span class=""caps"">ABSOLUTE</span> <span class=""caps"">ZERO</span> <span class=""caps"">BUT</span> WE DON&#8217;T <span class=""caps"">CARE</span> <span class=""caps"">AND</span> WE&#8217;RE REPUTABLE!&#8217; You&#8217;ll note (actually, you probably won&#8217;t &#8211; but that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m here for) that most of these are branded with the label <span class=""caps"">WCAN</span>, which happens to be the Wisconsin Classified Ads Network&#8217;s insignia. They list a disclaimer in the ads to the effect of &#8216;We&#8217;re sorry that some of our ads are ridiculous, but it&#8217;s really not our fault. Feel free to complain, but we&#8217;re fairly sure you don&#8217;t care sufficiently to do so.&#8217; (This disclaimer, incidentally, was listed directly alongside a listed opportunity for extra money and free trips to Tahiti, courtesy your friends at <span class=""caps"">WCAN</span>.)</p>

<p>The trademark of any alarmist ad is an overuse of exclamation marks, caps and bolded text. Simply because of <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1384277706451157121&#38;hl=en"">who I am</a>, I&#8217;ve discovered that 64% of the <span class=""caps"">WCAN</span> ads printed this week overused the exclamation marks, and 75% made gratuitous inclusions of all-cap or bold text. 85% of the exclamation&#8217;ed ads were also cap&#8217;ed or bolded (made bold?). You&#8217;d think <span class=""caps"">WCAN</span> would notice. ... Nah.</p>

<p>Hannah&#8217;s at work, and I&#8217;m trying to forget that I have work to do. :) Which isn&#8217;t too hard, <a href=""http://despair.com/proc24x30pri.html"">all things considering</a>.</p>

<p>Bob&#8217;s monitor is sitting in a box on the other side of the room. Blast. We set him up with a 21&#8221; widescreen lcd a while ago during the upgrades. The display was&#8230; hm. If a ghosted version of the screen image was blurred slightly and superimposed on the original, just nudged to the left, then that&#8217;s what it looked like. The replacement from HP came in, but the problem is still there. Which means that it&#8217;s either the cable (shouldn&#8217;t be; there were no problems with the old monitor) or there&#8217;s some kind of radiation under the desk. Bob&#8217;s not aware of any.</p>

<p>Went to the winter play at the high school last night: A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream.

<p><em>It&#8217;s Friday; I&#8217;m in love</em></p>

<p>Should probably go to bed at this juncture. Monday is inexorably approaching. ... Actually, they all are. A figurative infinity of Mondays, relentlessly marching on. Along with the rest of time, yeah.</p>

<p>The doctrine class this morning was excellent. The general topic concerned Jesus and his role, both in his incarnation and otherwise. It kind of transmuted itself into a discussion/debate over the motivation for creation and it could be justified.</p>

<p>Which is, in and of itself, a very interesting topic. Its premise goes something like this: &#8220;God is, by definition, infinite. Yes? Infinitely powerful, infinitely good, infinitely knowledgeable. Or omniscient, whichever you like. With that in mind, and knowing that God must have known what his creation would end up as (or has ended up as), why did he not create it so that it would <em>remain</em> perfect? Or, for that matter, how could he justify creating it in the first place?</p>

<p>Like the <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0310577012&#38;id=ZRAfBgZbLrAC&#38;pg=PP1&#38;lpg=PP1&#38;ots=BOPHOStn27&#38;dq=christianity+101&#38;sig=F55RmWsJiMoBE98PUb1Vg2VzSP8"">text</a> says, that&#8217;s kind of like accusing God of &#8220;cosmic sadism&#8221;. The general conclusion to that line of thought is that God, by nature a giving and loving entity, created humanity as&#8230; as almost the means for him to fully express a few of his own traits: forgiveness, grace, benevolence, etc. (That&#8217;s not to say that he needed humanity; that&#8217;s another conversation, but by definition he doesn&#8217;t.) He gave humanity free will, allowing them/us to choose (or not choose) to love God in return. Yeah, that results in a significant percentage of humans <em>not</em> choosing him, but that can&#8217;t reasonably be leveled at God as a point against him. Forcing his creation to love him would be&#8230; worthless and shallow.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m starting to ramble. :)</p>

<p>Which kind of goes into the whole predestination thing&#8230; Free will is possible because God, in his infinite ability, can limit his own sovereignty. Wrap your mind around that one. [ grins ]</p>

<p>Bah, that&#8217;s the end of that for tonight. Recommended books: Christianity 101 (very academic and deliberate approach to all of this), The Case for Faith (goes through a number of apparent problems with God and the like; very honest/straightforward review).</p>

<p>Innnnn any case&#8230; I love buttered popcorn. Delightful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Religion&#8221; bothers me. The word and its connotations. It takes the focus off of God and puts it on man&#8217;s interpretation of God. My approach to it all is largely intellectual, which is&#8230; well, that&#8217;s how I approach a lot of things. Most of life. Necessarily, though, any belief concerning anything beyond humanity has an element of faith to it. That&#8217;s naturally a little bit more difficult to accept, but is something that can be assimilated completely by a mere human worth dedicating yourself to?</p>

<p>Cause I&#8217;m looking at you through the glass&#8230;<br />
Don&#8217;t know how much time has passed<br />
All i know is that it feels like forever<br />
When no one ever tells you that forever<br />
Feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head</p>
<p>How much is real? So much to question<br />
And never dare make up the mannequins<br />
Contaminating everything<br />
When thought came from the heart<br />
It never did right from the start<br />
Just listen to the noises<br />
(No more sad voices)<br />
Before you tell yourself<br />
Its just a different scene<br />

<p>Poot. My dad came in with me to talk to Mrs. Hanson this morning, mostly regarding money and how to get it. :) Didn&#8217;t learn a whole lot there, only that procuring anything besides local scholarships and grants from the school in question will take some effort. Blast.</p>

<p>Mrs. Goldsworthy commented the other day that she didn&#8217;t think I had senioritus (or however that&#8217;s spelled), contrary to whatever the honorable Mr. Kitze may believe. Her observation is that I&#8217;ve ceased to see any <em>point</em> in high school. ... Which kind of <em>is</em> the going definition of senioritus, but it&#8217;s more of a decision than a lazy mindset. And honestly, I think she&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m only still semi-concerned about grades because of the <span class=""caps"">MIT</span> mid-year grade report&#8230;</p>

<p>My first closed-door with my boss has been suspended, due to a call-that&#8217;s-more-important-than-you. Ah well. He wants me to be working here more, which I&#8217;d <em>love</em> to do (most of the time), but it goes back to that 24 hours in a day thing. Day minus sleep minus school minus work minus decathlon minus miscellany = 24 &#8211; 6 &#8211; 7 &#8211; 2 &#8211; 5</p>

Left school after the Council meeting and went home, after stopping at work and the library. I picked up <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender&#39;s_Game"">Ender&#8217;s Game</a>.

<p>And so, with an entire day at home, I more or less consumed the thing. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0765342294/ref=dp_proddesc_0/102-3107980-8745738?ie=UTF8&#38;n=283155&#38;s=books"">Reviews</a> and <a href=""http://www.ender.com/ender/"">reading&#8230; supplements</a> there are, and in considerable number, I&#8217;m sure.

<p>... Which doesn&#8217;t likely give you a great picture of the book, but perhaps a bit of the flavor. &#8220;It&#8217;s a tragic tale of romance&#8230;&#8221; Not really, but I do recommend it. And those that follow.</p>

<p>By &#8220;all things&#8221;, I&#8217;m here referring to the human tendency to <em>move on</em>. People get sick of consistency &#8211; change change change change. Fashion, travel, news, tech. None of it really survives the mood swings of a society.</p>

<p>But in the middle of all that, we keep looking back. Or I do, anyway, and I&#8217;ve seen others do the same. People who miss what they call the golden age of music or whatever clothing trend they&#8217;re most fond of. Thinking out loud (or whatever), I guess it&#8217;s more the memories that are made (passive, Bronson) during those times than the characteristics of the times themselves.</p>

<p>Ha &#8211; three paragraphs starting with the letter B.</p>

<p>This all more or less has its roots in last year. I&#8217;ve had several grads in a row tell me that they miss <del>high school</del> 2005-06. Which&#8230; idk, I find kind of strange. Senioritus (there must be a better way to spell that) and all this &#8211; the desire to get past the present is very evident in the last few months of high school.</p>

<p>Or is it that? Maybe it&#8217;s just getting sick of the end. Kitze (the male) acts like that. No sense in drawing out what will inevitably end, right?</p>

<p>[ blinks ] Right, where was I? &#8230; Nostalgia. Missing the past. &#8230; Is there any real point in <em>that</em>? There&#8217;s acknowledging where you came from, yes, and that&#8217;s probably healthy. Learn from the past and all.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s probably no real point in going over this. It&#8217;s interesting, though, for a <del>race</del> society that always seems so ready to move on, that we often seem to look back wistfully at what we just passed on by.</p>

<p>[ feels like there&#8217;s more to be said ] How much does regret play into this, though? &#8230; No, never mind, that question isn&#8217;t really going anywhere either. I&#8217;m failing to muse properly. :) Regret&#8230; doesn&#8217;t always coincide with nostalgia. Nor, obviously, does it go the other way. Perhaps nostalgia is the more&#8230; <em>fitting</em> form of regret, after all. Looking back and missing it, but not necessarily wishing to go back to it. Like war stories. Ye battles of olde, maybe.</p>

<p>Bah, whatever. I miss you guys too. [ smiles ]</p>

2006-12-11 05:56:28,Unforgivable Sin / The Question of the Innocents,"<p>I&#8217;m starting to fall asleep, but I wanted to get this in writing before I actually do. Fall asleep.</p>

<p>This week, like last week, a few interesting points were brought up in the doctrine class. The two that stood out in my mind concerned the unforgivable sin and the fate of babies/children and the retarded who die.</p>

<p>So, starting with the first: unforgivable sin. The fact that there <em>is</em> one isn&#8217;t the question here, really; Jesus gives it as accusing the Holy Spirit and its work to be of evil &#8211; &#8220;blasphemy against the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href=""http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark%203:22-30&#38;version=31"">text</a> &#8211; I&#8217;m linking the <span class=""caps"">NIV</span> for readability&#8217;s sake). That aside, the idea I was toying with is whether or not a Christian (defined as one who have accepted Christ&#8217;s salvation, etc etc) can commit this particular sin. Perhaps this really isn&#8217;t muse-worthy, because I think the answer is fairly clear. No, one really can&#8217;t. A Christian is forgiven of an infinite amount of sin, really, because of the sacrifice of infinite quality that was/is Jesus Christ. But bringing the unforgivable into the mix: if the professing Christian truly has that relationship with God and is forgiven, the unforgivable sin cannot be a part of said Christian&#8217;s past/present/future because it was all forgiven. ... Yeah, not really muse-worthy. But interesting.</p>

<p>More muse-worthy is the question of the innocents. What happens to a baby who dies in infancy, or to the mentally-handicapped individual who doesn&#8217;t know his own name? The answer that one would like to hear is, of course, Heaven. What kind of god would damn an innocent soul? The key word there, however, is the word &#8216;innocent&#8217;. Technically, no one is innocent. Sin is something that more or less permeates the human condition, and has done so since what&#8217;s referred to as <em>The</em> Fall. Once introduced to humanity, the condition of sin remains simply because humanity could not and cannot remove it from itself. So, knowing this, the answer that we <em>don&#8217;t</em> want to hear is that a still-born infant ends up in Hell. ... Do I believe that? Honestly, it&#8217;s hard to say.</p>

<p>The other factor that needs to be considered is what I refer to as the point of sentiency. It&#8217;s why parents don&#8217;t (or shouldn&#8217;t) put one-year-olds in a time-out for spilling food. Punishing a being for something that it does not do consciously is fundamentally unfair. (Note that that&#8217;s different from doing something that said being does not <em>know</em> is bad.) Generally I&#8217;ve heard this called &#8216;the age of accountability&#8217; &#8211; the point at which the human mind attains consciousness or becomes sentient.</p>

<p>Which brings up another interesting question: if an infant or a retard (retarded to the point where a consciousness is not present) cannot think, do they have a soul? Do they exist in anything beyond physical form and instinctual reactions? If they do not, then the point is completely rendered moot. It becomes more like the question of whether or not pets go to Heaven, which I refuse to touch. :)</p>

<p>So, food for thought. I really don&#8217;t know the answer to this one, and I&#8217;m fairly sure that no answer can be satisfactorily attained. We&#8217;re only human, after all, trying to fathom the mysteries of infinity.</p>

<p><strong>addendum</strong><br />
I&#8217;m opting against a statement along the lines of &#8220;hope I didn&#8217;t offend anyone&#8221;, but I suppose I should probably say that, yes, infants are <em>developing</em> a sentiency. That&#8217;s what the growth process is all about, and arguing that infants can&#8217;t think is probably as plausible as arguing that adolescents can&#8217;t. [ grins ] That&#8217;s a stretch, but my point of clarification is that I don&#8217;t think babies are animals. ... As long as we&#8217;re clear on that.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv

<p>[ grins ] It&#8217;s been fun. The instructor was/is grand, not the least for her glasses.</p>

<p>And now for something entirely different: I&#8217;ve gotten results from <span class=""caps"">MIT</span>.

Don&#8217;t fret &#8211; most people end up with this. We&#8217;ll be in touch. In March.&#8221;</p>

<p>Listened to a song by <a href=""http://www.eliotlipp.net/"">Eliot</a> <a href=""http://www.pandora.com/music/artist/a9d351c114279e57"">Lipp</a> on the way in to school. Real Tragic; he sounds like a slim black dj. Which he&#8217;s not. Ha. Interesting sound, though. It grows on you.</p>

<p>Rather looks like sleet out there right now.</p>

<p><strong>addendum</strong><br />
Turns out those prospectuses (all of them) weren&#8217;t collated when they printed. Consequently, I&#8217;m now going through all seventy pages of each and manually putting the pages in order. Bah.</p>

<p><strong>post addendum</strong><br />
And then the printer, believing that it had had enough of the same old thing, opts to begin collating its print jobs. Just to shake things up a bit, see.</p>

<p><strong>4:00 addendum</strong><br />
The printer, just so you know, has decided to cease collating for the very last prospectus.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv

The week is done. &#8230; Granted, a new one will be starting promptly and a new one after that &#8211; a Monday will occasion itself every seven days of my life, but life goes on. I think that&#8217;s circular reasoning.</p>

<p>Anyway &#8211; I&#8217;m here at work, deciding exactly how much I&#8217;m going to allow myself to spend tomorrow. Ben M and I are going to wander Wausau for part of the day (Barnes/Noble, Fazoli&#8217;s, other shopping places for Christmas and whatnot); going to try to get the finale of the Matrix films in with Meg/Sam/Sam that evening.</p>

<p>I still have a craving for cheap frozen pizza.</p>

<p>Oh, incidentally, I fixed a couple bugs in the <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/am-paper"">a.m. paper</a> and added a feed for <a href=""http://crave.cnet.com/"">Crave</a>. Because I know you care. :)</p>

<p>So. I turn 18 tomorrow. That&#8217;s really probably inconsequential &#8211; my daily pattern will remain the same and it&#8217;s only another birthday with 70 to follow &#8211; but I&#8217;m kinda looking forward to it. As anyone would. Matt H&#8217;s all about the &#8220;smokes and porn&#8221;. ;) Speaking of Matt, there&#8217;s a <del>Facegroup</del> Facebook group for <a href=""http://hs.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2226605507""><span class=""caps"">RHS</span> Music Alumni</a>.

You&#8217;re the best.</p>

<p>In related news, I&#8217;m trying to write a song involving the line &#8220;we&#8217;re really only two shades of blue&#8221;. The line came up when Kitze questioned my integrity where it pertains to homework &#8211; yes, Kitze, I did indeed finish the assignment. In two shades of blue, no less. It sounds cool, but come to find out, the phrase has been used in a few <del>less than</del> unexpected places. :) Stay tuned.</p>

2006-12-18 02:47:25,Birthday Day,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/133.jpg"" /></p>	<p><strong>A Birthday</strong><br />
Picked up Ben and stopped at the Briar House before heading off in the general direction of Wausau. There was an Indian guy at the mall with a toy airplane launcher that he incessently demonstrated (something <a href=""http://www.target.com/gp/detail.html/601-4523871-7328916?asin=B000BDCGHQ&#38;AFID=Froogle&#38;LNM=B000BDCGHQ|Estes_AeroX_Interceptor_Indoor_R/C_Mobile_Cruiser_&#38;_Flying_Airplane=&#38;nAID=14110944&#38;ref=tgt_adv_XSG10001"">like this</a>, but less army-ish). Poor guy. Accomplished my main Christmas shopping objectives there, thankfully, and Ben found a bellybutton ring for someone. Ha &#8211; two guys trying to find the best ring in Claire&#8217;s. :)</p>

<p>On to Fazoli&#8217;s, where there was a little blonde boy with a mohawk cut. And Danielle Larson, I think. TJ Maxx, Best Buy, Barnes &#38; Noble. I found what I affectionately refer to as &#8220;twenty pounds of architecture&#8221;, though it&#8217;s closer to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/10-X-Haig-Beck/dp/0714843792"">ten</a>, whereas Ben discovered an anatomy coloring book. :)</p>

<p>At which point we kind of headed home&#8230; Discovered highway NN, which neither of us had previously known to exist, along with a liquidator&#8217;s store in a neighborhood that smelled of cheap Chinese food. Ben played DJ on the way back.</p>

<p>Spent the following&#8230; hm. eight hours at Meg&#8217;s house with varying numbers of others, enjoying Ben&#8217;s cake and the Matrix, in that order. A Shel Silverstein collection from Sam &#8211; thanks.</p>

<p><strong>B Birthday</strong><br />
Spent with family. [ smiles fondly ] Really very enjoyable/pleasant. (Interjection: No ballroom tomorrow!) Missed second service (Dad wasn&#8217;t feeling terribly well, if you must know), and&#8230; yeah, there wasn&#8217;t any point to that; nvm. Frozen pizza and cake. :) I love my family &#8211; I truly do. The gifts from them were all precious, even the Skittles from Aaron that promptly went into the candy vending machine on my desk for him to buy back. &#8230; Mom astonished me. A photo album, containing a collection tantamount to a record of my life. From Dad, a longer letter, and a promisary note for later investment. And a tie clip.</p>

<p>Oi. The things one treasures. Fond memories. Honestly, if I end up at <span class=""caps"">MIT</span>, I really hope I make it back for more than just Christmas and Spring Break.</p>

<p>Thanks, guys. (Assuming those reading this are the ones I know; probably not the guy from Iran.) Love you all.</p>

So yeah, I&#8217;m considered an adult now. :/ Feels a little different, knowing that, even though it&#8217;s really just another day older. Ah well. I looked forward to this for a <em>very</em> long time, waiting for the point at which I could <em>do</em> things on my own without having to have my parents&#8217; signature next to mine. Waiting to be taken seriously, I suppose. And I guess&#8230; I have that now? Idk. In the eyes of the law. I can sell stuff on eBay and buy cigarettes. (Matthew. You realize I&#8217;m going to think of you every time I walk into a gas station, right?) Mm. Bah, I&#8217;m having few discernible reactions.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still having difficulty wanting to&#8230; to keep moving, I suppose. I&#8217;ve found that, once I slip, I don&#8217;t necessarily want to get back to where I was in the beginning. Which could be passed off as laziness or lethargy, but I&#8217;m hesitant to call it that. Probably because those are both derogatory, and I&#8217;m talking about me here. :)</p>

<p>Things I want to do before I die:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jump onto a car on the freeway</li>
<li>Skydive</li>
<li>Achieve wide recognition for something that I&#8217;m proud of. Just once.</li>
<li>Get married?</li>
<li>Go on tour with Calah; release an album</li>
<li>End up where I&#8217;m supposed to be</li>
</ul>

Scanning Sparknotes for class. I do appreciate Virgil much more than Homer, but it gets so very long. I did scan through the original text, though. Justification.</p>

<p>Listening to <a href=""http://pandora.com"">Pandora</a> (after finally realizing that the monitor array I&#8217;m using has a speaker built into it). Their advertising technique is admirable and original &#8211; the advertiser seen is allowed to rebrand the entire page, not just toss in a banner.</p>

Ha &#8211; the Decathlon team had a psuedo-suprise mini-party at practice today. I didn&#8217;t go to work after school, not like usual, and Emma marched in with this cake. Knowing Emma to be the crafty person she is, and that she randomly shows up with food on occasion, I didn&#8217;t put much thought to it.</p>

<p>And then Sam told me that she needed me to go on a walk with her. &#8230; That was a little odd, but did I come to any kind of conclusion? Nah. I&#8217;m fairly oblivious when I&#8217;m not suspecting anything. Upon my return, I discovered straws and balloons in fairly large quantities. Far more straws than balloons. (There&#8217;s a story; ask me if you don&#8217;t know.) The cake apparently contained a layer each for <a href=""http://potterpuppetpals.com"">Potter Puppet Pals</a>, something I don&#8217;t remember, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_source_code"">The Matrix</a> and for <a href=""http://filmcow.com/charlietheunicorn.html"">Charlie the Unicorn</a>.

The freezing rain alert lasts until 0600 tomorrow; the winter storm warning until Saturday.

2006-12-23 05:21:31,Friday in Rhineville,"<p>Though more concerning Friday as I experienced it than for Rhinelander as a whole. Sorry.</p>

<p>That aside, school wasn&#8217;t canceled today, as I was disappointed to find in my feed aggregate. Blast. Crandon, Three Lakes, Elco, the lot of them &#8211; all canceled. Although&#8230; yeah, the weather/road conditions admittedly weren&#8217;t bad enough to call off school. I told myself this as I stared down my alarm clock this morning, trying to ignore its insistence that it is once again 6:25 and you should have been out of bed ten minutes ago, young man.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a tri-fold alarm clock that settled itself on my windowsill some time ago. It sits there, quietly waiting for its time to come. It doesn&#8217;t have power enough for the backlight anymore, but the alarm has grown more jarring with time, like the bitterness of an old man who&#8217;s started to realize that he never really had any effect on the world at all.</p>

<p>But so it goes. The office closed at three today; Hannah and I left school and came home directly. Honestly, it was so <em>very</em> nice to come home by 3:30, in some semblance of daylight, rather than at 6:00. My pants came in this afternoon also &#8211; a pair of Arizona carpenter <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/images/147.jpg"">jeans</a>, precisely the same as a pair that I&#8217;ve worn in and then some. My rockstar jeans. The new ones smelled both of old people and Goodwill merchandise; I&#8217;m not entirely sure what that means.

From outside this evening, wondering at the snow. Or, in this case, the lamp post.</p>

<p>A few quotes from today:</p>

<p>She seemed to fear nothing &#8211; and that, in my opinion, can be dangerous. (The Chorus; Antigone)<br />
It&#8217;s like those people that are in all your classes&#8230; and you <em>wish</em> they were your friends&#8230; (Hannah)<br />
And the city waits. (The Chorus, probably; Antigone)</p>

<p>I think I fixed the song from yesterday. Listen to it again, if you would. This song struck me rather oddly&#8230; Or in an unusual way, perhaps. Slightly unconventional, artistic/creative, and passionate. All together. For this reason, I&#8217;m giving you the song in all 192kbps of splendor.<br />

<p>It fundamentally bothers me when I see public material (e.g. poster, website, flyer, what-have-you) that is tasteless, especially when it&#8217;s for an institution that I otherwise support. You know this already, if you know me at all, but just now I&#8217;m specifically speaking of the local <a href=""http://ymcaofthenorthwoods.org"">YMCA</a>, the <a href=""http://www.rhinelanderchamber.com/"">Chamber of Commerce</a>, and <a href=""http://www.hodagsports.com/"">HodagSports.com</a>.</p>

<p>Looking at these sites really, really bothers me. The <span class=""caps"">YMCA</span> site, for example. Mixed fonts, random gradient, poorly executed navigation&#8230; there&#8217;s no consistency in the design. Same thing goes for HodagSports. In that way, the Chamber is slightly better, but only because the design simply has fewer elements in it.</p>

<p>And add the <a href=""http://www.roumancinema.com/"">local theatre</a> to the list. Of the four that I&#8217;ve mentioned, this one is probably the best, but by no means a work of art.</p>

<p>Which, granted, is not what they were made to be. All four sites are functional and accomplish their <em>practical</em> purpose &#8211; the information is communicated and a user leaves knowing, generally, what they needed to know.</p>

<p>But the <em>impression</em> given is lacking. No one will be looking at these sites unless they already intend on using the facilities (or&#8230; teams?) that the sites represent, because the sites are neither engaging or&#8230; well, pleasant to look at.</p>

<p>And I can deal with that, I suppose. So, evidently, can their owners, but to be honest &#8211; it kind of embarrasses me. I live here, I use the Y, I see occasional movies, etc etc, and they&#8217;re all &#8220;wicked decent&#8221;. [ nods to Ben W ] The thing is, if I were a guest looking through what Rhinelander has to offer, I&#8217;d think it terribly sub-par.</p>

<p>Probably because I pay attention to presentation as much or more than actual content, and I&#8217;m likely in the minority there. But isn&#8217;t presentation everything?</p>

Either my copy of the <span class=""caps"">LAME</span> encoder is dying, or&#8230; bah. Either way, the mp3 died and has left you, the reader, musicless. Apologies.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>

<p>Ah&#8230; &#8216;Tis the season &#8211; for <a href=""http://www.djbc.net/santastic/"">Christmas music remixes</a>. And the like.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m full and happy and tired, which actually has happened a lot lately. The Gustafsons are over just now, playing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blokus"">Blokus</a>. They come over for dinner every year, every Christmas evening. It&#8217;s kind of nice; they&#8217;re a great family. ... Also, there are only three of them, which balances out the seven of us rather nicely. :)</p>

<p>So. Sunday, we went off to the morning service (forgot to record the sermon as an mp3; will have to transcode it off the cassette), went home, and did nothing much until the evening service. We trucked the family off to the Gustafsons&#8217; church in Three Lakes, actually, which was very enjoyable. They produced the service&#8230; hm. More like a dramatic production with a message. Kind of. The narrarator, interestingly, sounded a lot like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Sam"">Microsoft</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:SpongeSebastian/101_Things_To_Do_With_Microsoft_Sam"">Sam</a>.</p>

<p>One thing I noticed &#8211; the theme of how Christ&#8217;s birth affected (or &#8220;rocked&#8221;, as Pastor Darrell put it) the people involved in the situation was present in both services. How <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446556/"">Joseph</a> must have felt, discovering that his officially betrothed wife has ended up pregnant, for example. An interesting approach; I guess I&#8217;ve never really considered that. The Biblical accounts are, at first glance, a little austere. &#8220;His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.&#8221; It&#8217;s worth considering what happened, between the lines.</p>

<p>Also interesting &#8211; someone was perusing materials on Germany (more on why on a later date) and came up something like &#8220;Christmas is a charming blend of pagan tradition and Euro-Christian influence.&#8221; Remember that, hear? Many American traditions/holidays are evidently Germanic in origin/influence, which came as somewhat of a surprise to me. Though I suppose Wisconsin is especially German&#8230; yeah, nvm.</p>

<p>As is generally done here, we&#8217;ve exchanged names for gifts &#8211; to be opened Christmas Eve after the evening service. [ changes tense ] I always enjoy that. Aaron and I ended up drawing each other&#8217;s names (&#8216;coincidence, surely&#8217;) &#8211; I found a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor%27s_Cube"">5&#215;5 Rubix Cube</a> for him, and tossed in a pink rubber ball to balance out the relative complexity of the cube, while he gave me a new alarm clock. It&#8217;s replaced the sour old clock that used to take residence on my window sill, and I am well pleased.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s probably all you need know, if any of that was necessary knowledge to begin with. But, all that being said, a very merry Christmas to you, God bless, and all the rest. ClichÃ©s and all.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv

Had a bit of an odd dream last night. My dreams as a whole are very involved and detailed, from having the Carmex in my pocket break open to the arching ceiling/walls of the auditorium. Remembering them is the hard part. :) But in any case, this one circled around an AI that seemed to be making its home in what must have been RHS&#8217;s new music hall. Very strange, but the interior design was magnificent. </p>

<p>Interestingly, I can remember the logo for the network that the AI was inhabiting.</p>

Ethan&#8217;s always been great at snowboarding. Or perhaps it shouldn&#8217;t formally be called &#8216;snowboarding&#8217;, per sÃ©, as he usually only uses those plastic boards without bindings as his weapon of choice. He was using one earlier today at the Rhody Christmas gathering at Donny&#8217;s place. We&#8217;d been sledding on the hill that ends in a pond, fairly steep and, as the pond is frozen, without undue danger of drowning.</p>

<p>Anyway, Ethan owned the hill more than once on that little board before discovering that the hill could indeed pwn him. He&#8217;s ended up with a compressed skull fracture &#8211; if you&#8217;re the type, your prayer for him would be grand. He&#8217;ll be flown out to Marshfield shortly.</p>

<p>That aside&#8230; bah. The sibs are watching Narnia; I&#8217;m going to wander off and join them.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

He&#8217;s still in Marshfield, but reportedly doing well. They&#8217;ve opted against surgery; guess the trauma incurred wouldn&#8217;t be worth it. Given that, he should be released tomorrow.</p>

2006-12-28 05:24:06,College,"<p>I&#8217;m <del>concerned</del> <del>worried</del> <del>freaking</del> rather nervous about <span class=""caps"">MIT</span>. My application was deferred, like 90% of them, and I&#8217;ll find out in March if I&#8217;m among the 10% of the deferred that are accepted.</p>

<p>Statistically, the odds are somewhat against me. My test scores generally fit in to the upper-mid-range of the middle 50% accepted (well, excepting my <span class=""caps"">SAT</span> Math Reasoning score, which was abysmal. Oddly, the <span class=""caps"">SAT</span> Subject Math II test score was far better), but they&#8217;re nothing stellar against MIT&#8217;s norm&#8230;</p>

<p>Meh. I just want to find <em>out</em>, one way or another. If I&#8217;m in, I&#8217;m in, and I&#8217;ll be in Massachusetts this time next year. (Actually not; it&#8217;ll be Christmas break still.) If I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;ll either be at Madison, Northwestern College, or Illinois Tech. Or hey &#8211; I could always go to Nicolet. :) Though&#8230; I truly think that <span class=""caps"">MIT</span> is my best match. (Albeit it&#8217;s whether I&#8217;m the best match for <span class=""caps"">MIT</span> that matters.) It&#8217;s a higher-level technically-inclined school that also puts emphasis on the right half of the brain &#8211; <em>creative</em> intellect. Which is what <em>I&#8217;m</em> about, and not many schools of MIT&#8217;s caliber work hard at achieving that balance.</p>

<p>Geeeahhh. I&#8217;m generally able to put aside worry. The promise that &#8216;all things work together for good for those who love God according to his purpose&#8217; is something that I hold to tightly, and I suppose it applies in my post-secondary education as well&#8230; Kinda bothers me that I can&#8217;t get myself past worry here in this relatively inconsequential item. I mean, yes, it does matter which college I end up going to, but one way or another, I think I will end up at a decent institution.</p>

<p>But, what happens happens, and the world won&#8217;t end come March. Then again, maybe it will, and the whole thing will be moot. You never know.</p>

<p>Washington & Lee has kindly reminded me that &#8220;it&#8217;s not too late too apply!&#8221; Bah. Colleges that spam don&#8217;t rank very high on my list. If a college needs to resort to spam to find applicants, then is it really any good?</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>

<p>Anyway. The day has come and gone, and just now it&#8217;s 9:30 pm. Ethan and Mom are still in Marshfield (though Ethan is likely to be released tomorrow-ish), and mostly everyone else is in the parlor watching Pride and Prejudice. Really an excellent film. Nothing terribly interesting on Facebook&#8230; Hm. I think I&#8217;m done here.</p>

2006-12-28 18:59:16,Cashette,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/154.jpg"" /></p>	<p>Whilst looking through memberlists, I found an email address at <a href=""http://cashette.com"">cashette.com</a>. Didn&#8217;t ring a bell, but Cashette seems to be a free email service that pays the user for each spam message they receive. The tagline:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Too much spam?<br />
Name Your Price for Spam <br />
You are paid for each &#8220;spam&#8221; you receive.	  <br />
If they don&#8217;t pay, you won&#8217;t receive spam!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doesn&#8217;t seem like a bad deal when you toss in 3gb of storage space. But do people really get paid for spam? A quick look through the testimonials only reveals rave reviews (r-r-r!) for the service itself, nothing about being paid. So &#8211; off to the &#8216;learn more&#8217; section.</p>

<p>And the first thing to learn is that &#8216;Cashette is a spam-control service.&#8217; Not necessarily email, then? But regardless of that (and the fact that Times New Roman appears randomly), Cashette only lets in email that&#8217;s from other Cashette addresses, or from addresses in your addressbook. The rest go through a BoxTrapper-esque process in which the sender must respond to an automatic reply before their message gets through. The result: only Cashette users can really spam you anyway (unless you have spammer friends), and they won&#8217;t be the ones spamming. Bah.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m registering an account now, just to see what the service is like&#8230; Oh, look. A checkbox: &#8216;I prefer to receive advertising email that pays me.&#8217;</p>

<p>Ohhh dear. The next step in the signup process is a demographic profile. Martial status, race, annual income. And the following notice:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To make more money, you need to provide profile information. We do not disclose any of your personal information to any third party. Advertisers only know that they are sending to a demographic group (e.g. age group).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So. They&#8217;re actually having spam sent to you <em>intentionally?</em></p>

<p>Next step is an ad for eBay. But that aside, I&#8217;m in. And I have three new messages: a welcome letter from Cashette support, and two spam messages from &#8216;no-reply@cashette.com&#8217;.</p>

<p>Gah. This is a <em>spam</em> farm. ... <em>And</em> an ad farm. Why do people use this? One of the testimonials says that it&#8217;s better than Gmail. Because it uses a less intelligent and less flexible spam filter?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve closed my account, even though the <a href=""http://www.cashette.com/myCashette/help/percent99.htm"">fine print</a> amused me.</p>

2006-12-28 22:33:06,iJournals,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/155.jpg"" /></p>	<p>Back in the day (here meaning 2005), I sort of took (here meaning &#8216;enrolled in, but did different work than&#8217;) a programming class at school. I sort of learned C++ (here meaning &#8216;took in the syntax and basic usage, but mostly worked with <span class=""caps"">PHP</span> instead&#8217;), and wrote a few programs.</p>

<p>The most involved one came to be known as iJournals. It had its origins in a user-management system I was working on and the minor frustrations had with three consecutive home-grown content management systems. And the fact that I wanted to start a journal, but didn&#8217;t feel like writing everything on paper in a notebook that I&#8217;d probably lose.</p>

<p>Thus, and after bouncing names off of Anthony for a while (remember SuperBucket? yeah, I&#8217;m still working on that one&#8230;), iJournals was born. Or rather, it slowly coalesced. I had yet to have any formal training in software development process or management (this <em>is</em> back in the day, you&#8217;ll recall), so development went along at its own pace and in its own way.</p>

<p>But the concept was fairly straightforward. &#8216;A simple, secure and uncluttered place to get your thoughts &#8220;down on paper&#8221;&#8217;, says the front page. Like blogging with no one watching, which is admittedly a less-than-common pursuit, but this was for the soul-searchers and diary-writers, not the <a href=""http://9rules.com"">9rulers</a>.</p>

<p>It actually was pretty cool. Sure, I didn&#8217;t use classes and the functions were very specialized, but I realized a few ideas with potential:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Clipboard. Almost exactly like <a href=""http://pastebin.com/"">pastebin</a>.</li>
<li>Conversations. Almost exactly like <a href=""http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=6559&#38;topic=1552"">Gmail&#8217;s rendition</a>.</li>
<li>A templating system. Almost exactly like the untold thousands of other systems out there. ...</li>
</ol>

<p>What&#8217;s frustrating is that I developed these totally oblivious to the more public versions. In addition to that, the iJournals concept is very close to that which <a href=""http://livejournal.com"">LiveJournal</a> is built around. I&#8217;m not sure if that proves that I&#8217;m a blind visionary or if I&#8217;m just clueless, but even though I was unknowingly building a system that was overshadowed from the beginning, I did learn a lot. Lots about database work, scripting, web hosting and the like. Valuable experience, and a few people actually did use the service. Granted, only 26 people, but it was still cool to see people <em>using</em> what I had built.</p>

<p>And, with this, I consign it to obsoletion. I&#8217;ve retired it to <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/ijournals/"">ikebowen.com/ijournals</a>, should anyone still want to toy with it, but mostly to fondly and nostalgically look back upon. Good times, working in Dachel&#8217;s (nÃ© Wollner) lab with fellow geeks (and the mere wannabes).</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv
2006-12-30 23:12:56,Untitled 390,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/156.jpg"" /></p>	<p>Quite possibly the strangest night of my life, beginning with my grandparent&#8217;s 50th anniversary. This wasn&#8217;t so very strange in and of itself, but I did have the chance to play some music with a 92-year-old accordion-player who had been at my grandparent&#8217;s wedding. Lucille. She&#8217;s since become my favorite person &#8211; a white-haired little dynamo with an accordion. Incredible.</p>

<p>Next item of interest &#8211; Aaron put a magnet up his nose on the way back home. While this wasn&#8217;t as unexpected as it sounds &#8211; he&#8217;d gotten a bunch of little iron magnet stones from someone earlier and was a bit bored &#8211; it was <em>exceedingly</em> strange. We couldn&#8217;t get it out for anything (and we did try an stronger floor magnet), so there was nothing for it but a trip to the ER. I mean, honestly. That&#8217;s the second time in <em>days</em>.</p>

<p>The third oddity goes right along with the second. The folk in the ER couldn&#8217;t find the magnet in the x-rays, so they had me bring the rest of the magnets in as samples to see if the x-ray could even pick them up. Thus, I brought in a handful of magnets to the local ER at 1:15 in the morning. How freaking weird is that?</p>

<p>And then the fourth. I ran over to the Holiday station afterwards to fill up the tank. Couldn&#8217;t remember the date; had to ask the attendant. Yes, I have my driver&#8217;s license. Bowen? No, I don&#8217;t know why that would sound familiar. ... Yeah, Nancy. ... Wait, you&#8217;re my second <em>cousin?</em></p>

<p>Aaannny way. Really a very strange evening. And I swear, if we have to make any more trips to ER before 2007&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But look at 2006 through a different lens and you&#8217;ll see another story, one that isn&#8217;t about conflict or great men. It&#8217;s a story about community and collaboration on a scale never seen before. It&#8217;s about the cosmic compendium of knowledge Wikipedia and the million-channel people&#8217;s network YouTube and the online metropolis MySpace. It&#8217;s about the many wresting power from the few and helping one another for nothing and how that will not only change the world, but also change the way the world changes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The conceptual Web 2.0 seems to be the greatest focus in the write-up, which seems interesting. Since Web 2.0 <em>is</em> all about the user base itself, selecting &#8216;you&#8217; is like turning the camera back on the photographer, citing the camera as the reason.</p>

<p>Lev Grossman did well, though, in acknowledging that the Web 2.0 movement shouldn&#8217;t be overly glorified:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure, it&#8217;s a mistake to romanticize all this any more than is strictly necessary. Web 2.0 harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom. Some of the comments on YouTube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone, never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred.</p>

Which is silly, because it wasn&#8217;t anywhere <em>near</em> that point, but that still prevented me from exporting the clip as one&#8230; chunk. Segment.

<p>There&#8217;s a shipment of 72 cobalt mugs with the group logo on them coming in to the office on Wednesday. That&#8217;s a lot of mugs.</p>

<p>You know, this week really did seem&#8230; long. Drawn out. Oddly, since it was a short week. Wednesday-Thursday-Friday. Kitze scheduled a Friday test on Wednesday, then said on Thursday that &#8220;the test [was] tomorrow&#8221;. Which confused me, because I didn&#8217;t think that Friday came next.</p>

<p>It did, and is now nearly over. I think we&#8217;re watching LoTR <span class=""caps"">III</span> tonight.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m having a recurring vision of a long weekend with no ties to anyone else. Just time and time to spare, with a fireplace, a good book or two&#8230; wireless broadband&#8230; [ grins ] And so life goes on.</p>

<p>Google is flexing their muscles. And it looks goood. $10 off a $10-min purchase? This after their $10 off of $30 and $20 off of $50 deals from earlier. They can afford it, evidently, and these veritable free money offers are guaranteed to draw users to their Checkout service. There was some speculation when the service was released as to whether it would have any success, given PayPal&#8217;s market share.</p>

<p>But this&#8230; this is ridiculous. It&#8217;s great for the consumer at the moment, yes, but it bothers me. It bothers me that Google is amassing the largest search db in existence. It bothers me that they can therefore monitor the collective mood of humanity so closely, especially now that users use Google to communicate and plan their own lives. It bothers me that they&#8217;ve acquired nearly 30 other companies, and that they&#8217;re now collecting financial data and using free money as the lure.</p>

<p>There are <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=google+conspiracy"">conspiracy theories</a> in abundance, of course. Tis the same with any growing power.</p>

Pictures, yes. Video, yes, and in stunning quality. But can you make a phone call?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found another way to classify people. There are those who have legitimate problems to deal with, those that do not but create issues to fill the void, and those that have none and lead blissfully happy existences. Of the legitimate-problem-havers, some just deal with them and keep moving without saying much while others are constantly trying to find a shoulder to cry on. This latter group is sometimes suspect of creating the problems in the first place, consciously or no.</p>

<p>Though it&#8217;s all point of view, I suppose. This came to mind when I realized that a good number of my closer friends have a lot to deal with, and few of them, if any, make a big deal of it. That&#8217;s usually not a bad trait. I rather think I&#8217;m in the final group mentioned above. There are different degrees of everything, but&#8230; hm. Yes.</p>

<p>So. Moral of the story &#8211; ignorance is bliss.</p>

<p>Apple products do not appeal to me. They just don&#8217;t. Yes, they&#8217;re brilliantly designed. Yes, they &#8220;just work&#8221;. Yes, the design is beautiful. But &#8211; they are branded. They scream suave coolness. Can a product be self-righteous? More power to Jobs for raising the bar and all, but&#8230; meh. I detest overt branding. Maybe that&#8217;s all.</p>

<p>Ha &#8211; the Apple TV (<em>thank you</em> for not calling it iTV) <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/gallery/first-apple-tv-pics/130339/"">includes</a> the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Burns_Effect"">Ken Burns effect</a>.</p>

I had wanted to create a blogging bot with it; send a message to the bot and it gets posted somewhere, <span class=""caps"">XML</span> feed maybe, and I actually asked Ferdy about the product with this in mind.

<p>So I realize that advertising services filter out phony clicks. But what about bad referrals?</p>

<p>For example: I was looking at an article on <a href=""http://wsj.com"">wsj.com</a>, and saw the plug for Toshiba (sponsor of the reprint/email thing &#8211; hooray!). The plug is served by Doubleclick.net with the following url:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>http://ad.doubleclick.net/clk;15359958;6853491;c?http://copiers.toshiba.com/index.shtml</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As expected, the url on the end sets the redirect and can be replaced with anything (<a href=""http://bannerfarm.ace.advertising.com/bannerfarm/97864/gps_give_120x600.swf?clickTag=http://www.boohbah.com/zone.html"">like this</a>). So &#8211; if someone were to switch that url to something else and somehow pull off a lot of legitimate clicks, would it entirely screw up the marketing stats?</p>

<p>The Rhinelander team&#8217;s decent, though lacking the sheer brilliance that we seemed to have on and off last year.

<p>The caravan left school a bit after 3:30 on Friday, heading for Stevens Point and a hotel that wasn&#8217;t bad but had a set of mounting holes screwed into the wall two feet above the flat-screen TV in the lobby. They also have cheap extra toothbrushes, but I think that&#8217;s the way it is in hotels as a rule.</p>

<p>So, we crammed Chinese history and whatnot until after midnight, but perhaps the speeches had the most work. For some reason, the team largely neglected the speechwork until the last week or so before competition. :)</p>

<p>For those of you unfamiliar with Academic Decathlon, it&#8217;s an academic decathlon competition (ha!) with the following events: language &#38; literature, art, music, social science, economics, mathematics, science, essay, interview, and speech (thank you, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadec"">Wikipedia</a>, because I would not have remembered them all). The science portion isn&#8217;t added until State, I believe, along with #11: Super Quiz. Besides local/regional/state/national competition, individuals compete at three levels, depending on their <span class=""caps"">GPA</span>: varsity/scholastic/honors (in ascending order). That aside, though, we study the topic at hand (&#8220;China&#8221; is incredibly broad, I&#8217;ll have you know) madly, then take tests (and interview and give speeches) madly, and then hope madly that we knew our stuff well enough.</p>

<p>Which we more or less did. The Rhinelander team placed fourth at the Stevens Point regional competition, which really isn&#8217;t bad. The difference between our score and the first place score was much less than last year (where we also placed fourth).</p>

<p>Wonder of wonders, I came away with a few ribbons. The ribbons are awarded on a per-something. per rank?-basis, meaning that the top three individual scores in the scholastic division on the music test are awarded. Et cetera. The music test was ironically one that I did not get a decent score on, nor the math test. The math test was abysmal, and I think that was across the board this year. I&#8217;m most proud of the speech ribbon, actually; I&#8217;ll post my speech tomorrow. I think it&#8217;s mostly because I&#8217;m competing at the scholastic division that I got the top-scorer award (also awarded per-something).</p>

<p>Rhinelander&#8217;s known for fanatical team spirit. I&#8217;m usually an exception to that, but the Decathlon teammates are really very close. When Amy got an art award, and one of the Abrams (they&#8217;re twins&#8230;) ended up with a math ribbon (surprise there), we cheered. Loudly, I suppose; the other teams were fairly quiet about it. Marathon apparently thought we were trying to beat them in volume, but we were just happy. :)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m praying we go on to State&#8230; The Madison competition is always such a blast. Kind of iffy this year, though, like it was last year. The first place team at each regional competition (there are five) automatically goes on, and then the top three or four teams per school division. Plus three wildcard teams, and I think we have a chance at a wildcard spot. We pulled one off last year, and&#8230; hm. Time will tell, along with my <span class=""caps"">MIT</span> application.</p>

<p>Ha. I love Decathlon. Dylan and I were walking past a group of hotel rooms, and someone started exiting what I thought was the Abrams&#8217; door. I turned and raised my arms in preparation to&#8230; idk, attack or something, but it wasn&#8217;t an Abrams. It was, in fact, a guy from a completely different team (several teams used that hotel) without a shirt. With my arms raised, we regarded each other passively for a moment. I turned and continued walking down the hall, and Dylan started cracking up. No words were said, no reactions. Completely ridiculous. [ grins ]</p>

2007-01-14 07:00:00,Forty-Two,"<p>In The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy, the ultimate answer is sought to the ultimate question: the great Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. The answer was discovered to be <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Answer_to_Life%2C_the_Universe%2C_and_Everything"">forty-two</a>, which understandably surprised those who sought it out. Whether or not it was correct, the answer was in effect worthless because it could not be understood &#8211; there was no apparent <em>reason</em> for The Answer to be forty-two.</p>

<p>Connecting this to reality &#8211; there are scores of religions and beliefsets that claim to have The Answer. However, if I were to meet someone who claimed to be of a certain religion, and they presented their beliefs but could not give a reason to back them up, their belief would be more or less worthless, whether it was correct or no. If I met someone else who believed differently but could defend their beliefs, theirs would be automatically worth more <em>because they could be defended</em>.</p>

<p>What if I told you that we do not have free will, and that God destroyed himself? How would you react? If I could not defend these statements, they&#8217;d be utterly ridiculous and most would reject them out of hand. But what if I could?</p>

<p>Let me first examine the dimensional universe. The first dimension is a line, the second is a plane and the addition of the third results in the 3D space that we humans move through. Because we exist and are defined, all other points in the first three dimensions must also exist and likewise be defined. To illustrate this, because <em>you</em> exist, it can be known precisely what there is forty-five meters to your left. Now, let me bring in the fourth dimension, largely considered to be time. Because we exist at a point in time, it follows that all other points must also exist and be defined. If all points in time are defined and set, there is no room for deviation. If deviation is impossible, then we do not have free will.</p>

<p>Perhaps <em>God</em> is a more interesting subject, with many more viewpoints and also several wars. I&#8217;m going to begin with several commonly held assumptions: that God exists, God is infinite in both power and knowledge, and for the sake of convenience, that God is male. What would motivate such a god to act? What could <em>possibly</em> motivate a being that could do anything, already would know the results of doing everything, and because he has power over time it&#8217;s as if everything is already done? Only an action with an unknown result could possibly hold any interest. If the only unknown for an omniscient god is his own <em>non-existence</em>, then the only action with motivation would be his own <em>self-destruction</em>.</p>

<p>Now let me bring humanity into the picture. Humanity exists. This is widely accepted, with the exception of some <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-structuralism"">post-structuralists</a> and perhaps <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dummett"">Michael Dummett</a>. With our assumptions concerning God, humanity&#8217;s existence is proof that God acted at one point in such a way that humanity came about as a result. Given this and our conclusion concerning God, the connection is plain: God destroyed himself, and we are what remains. God destroyed himself, and we are his debris.</p>

<p>My purpose in all of this is not to invalidate religion, nor to question justice on the basis of free will. My purpose is simply to drive home my original point: for a belief to have merit, there must be reasons behind it. Had I presented my arguments without defense, they, like forty-two, would be entirely worthless.</p>

<p>To close: no matter what I believe, or what you believe, no matter who, if anyone, is correct, belief must be founded with a reason.</p>

<p>If you believe, <em>know why</em>.</p>

<p><strong>fairly late afterthought</strong> (2008-10-02)<br />
The following disclaimer will go on and attempt to ensure that you don&#8217;t draw any conclusions regarding yours truly. Ignore most/all of that. Thoughts on the subject have evolved somewhat in the last nine months, and not all of the below applies.</p>

<p><strong>rather large disclaimer</strong> (2008-01-16)<br />
This speech was fairly interesting in its evolution. The seeds, perhaps, were planted in my reading of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God%27s_Debris"">God&#8217;s Debris</a> (have I mentioned it yet?) which I actually have yet to finish. My first thought was to write a speech on the future, quickly dismissed as far too broad for 3.5 minutes. I next considered writing a speech disproving the existence of God.</p>

<p>If you know me, and it&#8217;s likely you do if you&#8217;re reading this, you know that I am a Christian. I dislike the word &#8216;religion&#8217; as it refers to humanity&#8217;s interpretation of God, whereas I try to focus on God&#8217;s interaction with humanity. This is an entirely separate subject, so I&#8217;ll leave it there for now.</p>

<p>Anyway, the speech disproving God&#8217;s existence would have been an experiment, mostly to see if I could competently write such a thing and keep all personal bias out of the picture. I started writing this one, actually, working in a smaller thought experiment concerning the dimensional universe and how it relates to free will. I made a loose connection between the logical impossibility of free will and God&#8217;s existence, and somewhere in the process the speech topic changed to what it is now: the necessity of purpose and reason in and behind belief.</p>

<p>I wholeheartedly agree with the speech&#8217;s thesis, but completely disagree with both of the examples presented: the non-existence of free will and God&#8217;s self-destruction. Therein lies the experiment that I started with &#8211; the removal of bias. I think I pulled if off. The free will reasoning is my own (though others have probably come up with it as well; I haven&#8217;t looked), but the self-destruction of God came straight out of God&#8217;s Debris. (Marvelous book, by the way.)</p>

2007-01-18 02:55:54,Things for Today,"<p><strong>Tulane and Northern Arizona</strong><br />
Both schools sent me messages today (which is now yesterday), stating something to the effect of &#8220;we were expecting to see an application from you before today but didn&#8217;t&#8230; so we&#8217;re extending the deadline and waiving the application fee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing says top-caliber school like this does.</p>

<p>Seeing that the messages looked so very similar, and came on the same day, I checked the source of the messages to see where they actually came from. They were both mailed from app-info.net, which is a domain owned by the guys at <a href=""http://royall.com"">Royall & Company</a>. Marketing specialists for colleges, looks like. They&#8217;ve done a decent job, I suppose. It surprises me that colleges using their system have to buy a separate domain name to use with their services (Tulane uses tulaneinfo.org instead of tulane.edu, etc)... Although, perhaps that&#8217;s just the domain of the mailer. <a href=""http://tulaneinfo.org"">tulaneinfo.org</a> and <a href=""http://northernarizonau.org"">northernarizonau.org</a> both have precisely the same content, but they point the user toward the .edu domain&#8230; ah well. Hooray for marketers.</p>

<p>That really really bothers me. I&#8217;ll be sending three B+&#8216;s, one B and a B- in to <span class=""caps"">MIT</span>. Unremarkable. Though they&#8217;re all in AP/weighted classes, and I&#8217;ll have my work credits in there&#8230; bah.</p>

The subject&#8217;s climatology, which is&#8230; going to be difficult. Given its less-than-entirely-objective nature (e.g. &#8220;and <em>this</em> is what we&#8217;ve observed over the last 50 years, and most have concluded <em>this</em> about it, but this conclusion is debated and the observation period really isn&#8217;t long enough to come up with anything concrete anyway&#8221;; to put this in perspective, previous subjects have included The Ancient World, Lewis/Clark, the brain&#8230;), I rather expect it to be difficult to keep straight. Interesting material, though. We&#8217;ve decided to create a candy called the Millibar, advertised by emo actors, with the tagline &#8220;It&#8217;s <em>Destructively</em> Delicious!&#8221;.</p>

Took a three hour nap earlier today and, oddly, dreamed that I was stuck in town at night in the winter. Couldn&#8217;t think clearly, even in a dream, so after concluding that it was too far and too cold to walk home, I set off the proximity alarm at someone&#8217;s house and asked to use their phone.

2007-01-22 06:33:50,Zune: Categorizing Video,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/540.jpg"" /></p>	<p>If you haven&#8217;t touched the preloaded video on your Zune, you&#8217;ll note that there are two categories in the video section: &#8220;All Videos&#8221; and &#8220;Music Videos&#8221;. This is all well and good, but what if you want to add music video from your own library to the appropriate category? It&#8217;s surprising to me that the Zune software doesn&#8217;t make this easier, but there really is no simple way to do this. Microsoft does give you a hint in <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929005/en-us"">kb article 929005</a>, but falls short of actually telling you what to do.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is a solution that will suffice until MS adds this as a feature. The following assumes that your videos are all wmv&#8217;s already; scroll further down if they&#8217;re not.</p>

<p><strong>download this</strong><br />
<a href=""http://www.hot.ee/siim04/english.html#eng_WMAE"">WM Attributes Editor</a> (I use the English version, myself.)</p>

<ol>
<li>Unzip the editor somewhere, making sure to keep the manifest file alongside the executable.</li>
<li><strong>Important:</strong> close the Zune software and anything else that might be using the files in question.</li>
<li>Run WMAttributeEditor.exe</li>
<li>File -&#62; Open Files
<ol>
<li>Select all wmv files (hold shift) that belong in <em>x</em> category/genre (e.g. your music videos); hit Open.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Tools -&#62; Mass altering (which sounds weird, but isn&#8217;t)</li>
<li>See the &#8220;Name&#8221; selector? Find &#8220;WM/MediaClassPrimaryID&#8221;.
<ol>
<li>Further down, there&#8217;s a selector called &#8220;Special&#8221;. Select &#8220;Video&#8221;.</li>
<li>Click on the &#8220;Add&#8221; button.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Back up to &#8220;Name&#8221; &#8211; select &#8220;WM/MediaClassSecondaryID&#8221;
<ol>
<li>&#8220;Special&#8221; = [appropriate genre &#8211; only feature-length movies, music videos and TV shows are supported for now]</li>
<li>Click &#8220;Add&#8221;.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Lower-right corner of the window: click &#8220;Commit changes&#8221;.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that, hopefully, should do it. Sync your Zune again and you should see additional categories in the video section with your video collection satisfactorily sorted. If not, you&#8217;re more or less on your own &#8211; post here or over at <a href=""http://zunemax.com"">ZuneMAX</a> if you&#8217;re having issues.</p>

<p>All of this aside, there&#8217;s obviously more than just the two media classes that can be set. However, not all metadata entries will transfer over to the Zune device at the moment, as noted on the <a href=""http://www.zune.net/en-us/support/howto/start/providecontent.htm"">Zune website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the initial release of Zune, WM/Year, Author, and WM/Genre metadata does not transfer to the Zune device. This will be addressed in future updates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>If your video collection is in any format other than wmv</strong>, all is not lost. If you already use Zune to manage your collection, try this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Apply the <a href=""http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2006/11/how_to_copy_dat.html"">storage hack</a>.</li>
<li>With the Zune software open and your device connected, open up My Computer.</li>
<li>Look for your Zune device somewhere in the list &#8211; should have a telling icon of some kind.</li>
<li>Open &#8216;er up -&#62; Storage -&#62; Video</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll see your video collection here in wmv format. Copy it back to your hard drive and replace your existing files with these. I&#8217;d keep a backup somewhere, just in case.</li>
<li>Follow the steps from earlier, and you should be set.</li>
</ol>

<p>If not, and you really don&#8217;t want to use Zune to convert the files (can&#8217;t really fathom why, but it&#8217;s possible), you might try the <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/9series/encoder/default.aspx"">WM Encoder</a> from MS.</p>

She went down to the den and noticed a statue in the corner &#8211; a full-size sculpture, probably five foot ten, dressed as a clown. &#8220;Expensive.&#8221; It actually looked a bit unnerving (&#8220;Why <em>would</em> you have a clown statue in the basement den?&#8221;), so she called the kid&#8217;s parents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you mind if I moved the clown statue into the storage room for the night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;... We don&#8217;t <em>have</em> a clown statue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;...&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;!!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Turns out that it was an actual <em>person</em> (evidently frozen in shock upon seeing the sitter) who had been <em>living</em> in the storage area of the basement, coming out during the day when the house&#8217;s occupants were out. When the kids said earlier that they were &#8220;playing with the clown&#8221;, the parents more or less assumed that they had an imaginary clown or perhaps a toy that someone brought. </p>

<p><em>Not</em> an actual clown.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m in the left lane of Lincoln street behind a dark magenta four-door. Looked too budget-class to be considered a sports car or anything. There&#8217;s a car next to me in the right-hand lane &#8211; it&#8217;s a rich magenta (there&#8217;s a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magenta"">difference</a>) sports car with curves.</p>

<p>My dilemma is of course this: which car should I stay behind to get to Walmart with the greatest speed?</p>

<p>First thought: The sports car is probably going to be faster. Second thought: It&#8217;s not. Observations: The four-door ahead of me is screaming <em>female assertiveness suppressed by socio-demographic factors!</em> while the one on my right is in all likelihood driven by an upper-class blonde &#8211; the car looks flashy (and is nearly pink and has curves), the driver is probably concerned about how it looks, the driver is probably both female and looks at things very much from her own point of view which doesn&#8217;t seem to be practical efficiency. Ergo, she&#8217;s less likely to innately want to go faster than the married college-grad ahead of me.</p>

<p>Which seemed to be the case, until the rich magenta sports car decided half a mile ahead to speed up by 5-7mph. My guess is that the driver realized she was being beaten by a four-door. Should have seen that coming.</p>

<p><strong>Reactions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>He&#8217;s using YouTube. That&#8217;s taking it a step up (or down) from Hillary in playing to the masses</li>
<li>0:24 Convincing convinced US citizen. Female. Caucasian.</li>
<li>0:34 Appeal to hope. Male. Hispanic.</li>
<li>0:48 Sense of humor shown.</li>
<li>0:50 Parents divorced &#8211; the pity here could be dangerous&#8230;</li>
<li>0:56 Same thing with the father dying. Hmmm.</li>
<li>1:05 Looks like it was safely turned around to a diverse background thing. Indonesia -> <span class=""caps"">USA</span>...</li>
<li>1:12 Self-made man. Good and American.</li>
<li>1:18 Community involvement &#8211; well-rounded interests.</li>
<li>1:25 A recent-looking picture of him posed in a classroom. Sepia. For effect?</li>
<li>1:40 Power of the ordinary people working together. Reasonable appeal&#8230; Predictable, though.</li>
<li>2:15 Though I like where this is going with the &#8220;local-level wasn&#8217;t big enough&#8221; concept. Teaching background is also good.</li>
<li>2:25 Family/Religious appeal</li>
<li>2:30 Awww&#8230;.</li>
<li>2:50 List of achievements. Objective &#8211; good.</li>
<li>3:11 Oh, look. He opposed the war in Irahq. Hindsight, as they say&#8230; not a bad point, though.</li>
<li>3:30 &#8220;Democrats from all over Illinois&#8230;&#8221; This after &#8220;there <em>is</em> no Liberal, no Conservative America&#8230;&#8221;</li>
<li>3:57 Appropriate musical crescendo with rousing applause.</li>
<li>4:30-ish Shots that are obviously staged are fairly meaningless. Even if it is on a farm.</li>
<li>4:42 &#8220;... he&#8217;s brought Democrats and Republicans together for the common good.&#8221; Sorry, Indies.</li>
<li>4:52 An attack on the pundits. [ laughs ]</li>
<li>5:40 Ends with the campaign url.</li>
</ol>

<p>Not bad. Still an emotional appeal, but then, that&#8217;s what works for most of America.</p>

<p>The biggest parallel I&#8217;m seeing between <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=WGGIHqIoP2k"">this</a> and <a href=""http://www.hillaryclinton.com/feature/video/?sc=8"">Hillary&#8217;s schpeech</a> is a cross-party appeal. Or an attempt at one, anyway. Referring to &#8220;us all&#8221;, rather than a specific party. Never mind that a lot of Barack&#8217;s footage was from his Dem campaign; he was in a partisan senate, after all.</p>

<p>Hm. I&#8217;ll be interested (along with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election#Voter_turnout"">maybe 60% of America</a> &#8211; we really do suck <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Turnout.png"">compared to the rest of the world</a>) to see how this develops.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s kind of a dangerous thing. American Idol. (As an aside, I&#8217;m looking at the Idol website just now&#8230; There&#8217;s a McDonalds ad on the side, one of the &#8216;dollar menunaire&#8217; ones. &#8220;The Dollar Menunaire doesn&#8217;t pay for music. [ character winks ] She &#8216;shares&#8217; it.&#8221; &#8230; What? McDonalds, have you sunken this low?) Jewel&#8217;s guest judging for this round, and had this to say in a <a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16723315/site/newsweek/"">Newsweek Q&#38;A</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s it like judging &#8220;Idol&#8221;?</strong><br />
It really is heartbreaking, seeing those kids walk out of there dejected.</p>
<p><strong>But there were so many terrible performers.</strong><br />
I thought a lot of the contestants were going to know they sucked and do it as a joke. I was shocked at the seriousness of them. They really, really believed they were going to win. The difference between the twoâ€”what they are, what they think they areâ€”is so great, there&#8217;s no way to bridge it. All of a sudden you&#8217;re shattering somebody&#8217;s perception of themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Newsweek <a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16600109/site/newsweek/page/2/"">stated earlier</a> that &#8220;31% of teenagers believe they will be famous when they grow up&#8221;. I mean, honestly. I completely believe that figure &#8211; the quest for fame seems to be <a href=""http://www.jakehalpern.com/journalism/TextStories/famePT.html"">a trademark of my generation</a>.</p>

<p>For all that we may be the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGeneration"">internet generation</a> (or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Y"">GenY</a>, for that matter), it seems that having so many points of view presented has rather made it more difficult to assume a wide/broad point of view. Humans are inherently one-sided in their approaches, and as increased exposure to other &#8216;sides&#8217; makes judgments more relative, I&#8217;m seeing people actually be less inclined toward seriously considering other points of view &#8211; instead, holding on more tightly to their own for fear that it may become moot.</p>

<p>Maybe that&#8217;s why some Idol contestants seem to be so deluded. Perhaps. I&#8217;m kind of talking about two different ideas here and making vague connections between the two, but I do think the connection is there. Isolated as we are in a global network, we&#8217;re clinging to the remains of our self-perception in the hope that we&#8217;re still worth something.</p>

<p>Gmail didn&#8217;t think this was a phishing attempt, nor did Firefox think anything odd about a <span class=""caps"">URL</span> with an octet-encoded IP. (It does now.)</p>

<p>The headers on the email revealed that the message had a Comcast-based ID and I&#8217;m fairly sure that it also had a User-Agent/X-Mailer set to Thunderbird (can&#8217;t find that now, oddly).</p>

<p>Anyway, the phish page. It&#8217;s been taken down now (ha), but it was a survey form with the <a href=""http://cuna.org"">CUNA</a> template around it (official/valid links and all). The questions were fairly normal (&#8220;How satisfied are you with your credit union?&#8221;), the only oddity being that they were multiple-select boxes instead of the usual radio button or drop-down thinger. The important stuff was at the bottom of the page (&#8220;important stuff&#8221; here means inputs for full name, email, credit card number, cc verification number, account <span class=""caps"">PIN</span> and <span class=""caps"">ATM</span> access code). The fool. The promised reward was 50USD credited to your credit card using the requested information, as if you <em>need</em> the <span class=""caps"">ATM</span> code for that.</p>

<p>The <span class=""caps"">URL</span> looked like this: http://0xd8.0xef.0x10.0x90/cuna/cuna.php?process=sign-up. This wouldn&#8217;t be terribly strange, had <span class=""caps"">CUNA</span> been using a cPanel server (missing a tilde in the address, though). A visit to <a href=""http://0xd8.0xef.0x10.0x90/"">the webroot</a> returned a default congrats-you&#8217;ve-installed-the-server-correctly page (at that time; it&#8217;s now &#8211; oddly &#8211; a security cam page), meaning that the phisher in question was probably running this on his home box with PHPTriad (a now-defunct <acronym title=""Apache, MySQL, PHP"">AMP</acronym> stack). I tried screwing around with the scripts he was using (4111-1111-1111-1111 is a valid &#8211; bogus &#8211; <span class=""caps"">VISA</span> number) and the server itself, but didn&#8217;t get very far&#8230; He wasn&#8217;t <a href=""http://cyber-knowledge.net/blog/2006/09/16/analyzing-20000-myspace-passwords/"">an idiot</a>, evidently.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class=""caps"">WASHINGTON</span>, Jan 29 &#8211; President George W. Bush said on Monday he did not intend to insult Democrats by failing to pronounce their party&#8217;s full name in his State of the Union address.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know I did it,&#8221; Bush told <span class=""caps"">NPR</span> in an interview.</p>
<p>In his speech last Tuesday, Bush declared to a joint session of the U.S. Congress that &#8220;I congratulate the Democrat majority.&#8221; Some Democrats were incensed he did not say &#8220;Democratic.&#8221; The party&#8217;s proper name is the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Republicans for years have dropped the last two letters of the name as a slight to the party. Bush&#8217;s prepared text of his speech had the proper name but he misstated it in his address.</p>
<p>Bush called it an oversight and said he was &#8220;not that good at pronouncing words anyway.&#8221; He said he was surprised at the level of distrust in Washington.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a lot of politics in Washington &#8212; in my judgment, needless politics. And it&#8217;s almost like, &#8216;If George Bush is for it, we&#8217;re against it,&#8217; and &#8216;If he&#8217;s against it, we&#8217;re for it.&#8217; And the American people don&#8217;t like that,&#8221; Bush said.</p>
<p>In his speech, Bush went out of his way to praise California Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the new speaker of the House of Representatives, and declared his intent to work with Democrats in the majority of the House and Senate.</p>

Not that it&#8217;d be a bad thing, by any means; it&#8217;d just mean that I wouldn&#8217;t be going to <span class=""caps"">MIT</span>. This is one of the situations where you&#8217;re afraid to hope too much.</p>

<p>Which I suppose I don&#8217;t end up in often. &#8220;Hope&#8221; is inherently a foolish thing. Which sounds cold, but it honestly is &#8211; what happens will happen, and if you hoped for it, well, okay. If you didn&#8217;t, you were setting yourself up for disappointment. What do you gain by a realized hope? Fulfillment?</p>

<p>Though I suppose the same thought process could be applied to emotion. What you <em>feel</em>. Ech. What is <em>feel</em>? What&#8217;s the value of something intangible, generated by a flesh machine, which can cause it to act irrationally? <em>Is</em> the brain a machine? Every input triggers, on some level, a physical change within the brain which can only have one reaction (another point against <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/blog/?q=free+will"">free will</a>). If it&#8217;s not a machine and you really can decide how to react, then where does that choice take place? It can&#8217;t logically take place in the brain, can it?</p>

2007-02-01 03:53:29,The Antigo Silt Loam Song,"<p>Before I begin, I&#8217;d like to clue you in on something that only the lucky elementary students who benefit from <a href=""http://www.globe.gov/"">the <span class=""caps"">GLOBE</span> program</a> know:</p>

<p>Some people are really very passionate about <del>dirt</del> the soil.</p>

<p>And don&#8217;t take that wrong &#8211; I live in rural Wisconsin, I recognize that it&#8217;s important. &#8230; But <a href=""http://www.soils.wisc.edu/~barak/fdh/"">F. D. Hole</a>, may he rest in peace, took a love of the soil to new <del>heights</del> ground. For proper effect when you read the following aria, find a secluded grove and sit by yourself with your shoes off to the side. The chords are F, A, Bb, F, Bb, F, Bb, C7, F.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Great Lakes region, fertile land; glaciers spread both clay and sand;<br />
Winds blew silt, then forests grew, giving soils their brownish hue.<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Great Lakes region, fertile land, you strengthen us in heart and hand;<br />
Each slope, each flower, each wild bird call proclaims a unity in all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(At this point, the congregation will please rise.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <em>Antigo, a soil to know, Wisconsin&#8217;s crops and livestock grow;<br />
and forests too, on Antigo; and forests too, on Antigo.</em><br />
<strong>4.</strong> Plant a seed and pull a weed; the soil will give us all we need<br />
And plenty more, so birds may feed: and plenty more, so birds may feed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(The music here shall quiet and leave only the twelve-string guitar and the violin synth.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Of all the crops, true peace is tops; its soil is love that never stops;<br />
It blesses sand and water drops: it blesses sand and water drops.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8230; I&#8217;m trying not to die here, honestly&#8230; the performance notes are blatantly fallacy, but does <a href=""http://www.soils.wisc.edu/~barak/fdh/fdhsongs.pdf"">this</a> not look like something religious?</p>

<p>Now, it&#8217;s important to note that Francis wasn&#8217;t the only one to write songs in holy exaltation of terra firma. Dozens of primer-school agriculture inductees have written their own anthems, many of which have already <a href=""http://www.urbanext.uiuc.edu/soil/songs/songs.htm"">been cataloged</a>.</p>

<p>There is, for example, &#8220;I Wanna Dig&#8221;, sung to the tune of the Spice Girl&#8217;s &#8220;I Wanna Be&#8221; (&#8220;If you wanna be my partner, get down and dig, / We&#8217;ll be doing this forever, so you&#8217;d better make it quick. &#8230; Collect those soil samples, how wet does it feel?&#8221;), &#8220;Old McDonald Had a Pit&#8221;, &#8220;You Are My Soil, My Only Soil&#8221;, and even &#8220;I Love Dirt&#8221; (to the tune of &#8220;Three Blind Mice&#8221; &#8211; you can credit the state of <a href=""http://www.okfarmbureau.org/programs/agInTheClassroom.asp"">Oklahoma</a> proper for that one).</p>

<p>But I shall leave you with this, one final chorale of F. D. Hole in honor of (oh give me) the loam:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are soils in south New Zealand.<br />
There are soils in China West.<br />
There are soils in Argentina&#8217;s pampas.<br />
There are soils in Hawaii&#8217;s islands blest.<br />
There are soils all over these vast landscapes,<br />
in whatever land your foot steps fall;<br />
But the _____________________*<br />
They are the very best of all!</p>
<p>* Select line from choices below:<br />
1.  soils of southern steppes of Russia<br />
2.  prairie soils of North America<br />
3.  regur clays of central India<br />
4.  plaggen soils of the dear old Netherlands<br />
5.  volcanic soils of Indonesia<br />
6.  alluvial soils of upper Amazon</p>

2007-02-02 03:22:23,Question for you.,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/203.jpg"" /></p>	<p>From the local paper&#8230; They&#8217;ve <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/blog/?q=turtles"">mentioned turtles before</a>.</p>

<p>And now that we&#8217;ve got that aside, consider the hash. Not the drug, nor the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_House_Harriers"">drinking/running clubs</a>, but the hash function:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A hash function (or hash algorithm) is a reproducible method of turning data (usually a message or a file) into a number suitable to be handled by a computer. These functions provide a way of creating a small digital &#8220;fingerprint&#8221; from any kind of data.<br />
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function""><em>Wikipedia</em></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The MD5 hash of &#8220;foo&#8221;, for example, is acbd18db4cc2f85cedef654fccc4a4d8.</p>

<p>A question, then. A few hash functions, <a href=""http://www.cits.rub.de/MD5Collisions/"">MD5</a> for example, have exploited weaknesses, meaning that inputs can be constructed that generate a given hash. This poses a problem for security and whatnot. But can we use that for data archival?</p>

<p>Say a hash function is written for which two inputs of the same length cannot have the same hash output. Example: thishash($a) &lt;&gt; thishash($b) where strlen($a) &lt;&gt; strlen($b).</p>

<p>If this is so, and inputs can be constructed to match a given hash value for this function, then it should be possible to plug any input into the function and, given the length of the original input and the resulting hash, rebuild the original input from scratch.</p>

<p>Correct me if I have my concepts skewed, but this could be great for data archival. &#8230; Might take a while, but it should be theoretically possible to rebuild the Wikipedia article on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle"">turtles</a> given only 5164cabf185abcc87d5a37ef30e86ec6 and an input string length of 18407.

We were planning on starting at nine and ending at noon, but considering that I was there until three last weekend, getting out of the office at two wasn&#8217;t bad. The backup system needed to be completely reset. It was dying slowly.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re beginning to assemble a presentation for one of the larger clients. I can legally tell you that, for this purpose, I was commissioned with the purchase of a number of 3&#8221; binders.</p>

<p>As it was still Saturday at the time, someone locked the office entrance after I left. Despite my request to the contrary. Meh. I get back from OfficeMax with a set of presentation binders, wearing a long-sleeve tshirt, and someone had locked the door on me.</p>

<li>Down in the basement &#8211; find a fusebox with labels made 25 years ago that no longer seem to apply to anything. Who&#8217;s Chuck?</li>
<li>Someone else finds another fusebox. None of the fuses are tripped, but one isn&#8217;t red while the others are. They flip it and the main server rack blinks.</li>
<li>They flip it again.</li>
<li>The main server rack dies. And, fortunately, comes back.</li>
<li>The entire office looses its connection to the various work-related networks.</li>
<li>Panic ensues.</li>
<li>We call the guy who owns the place to see if we can get the electrician to come in and sort everything out. He won&#8217;t let us &#8211; the fee, you know.</li>
<li>But he will let us call in the garbage man.</li>
<li>Who sorts out everything in five seconds.</li>

I found out why the analytics program was broken. The local server thought it was Wednesday (it&#8217;s not, actually), posing a problem when it tried to connect to another network in a future context. ... Yes, this took a conference call to figure out. I felt like an idiot.</p>

<p><strong>11:19 am</strong><br />
Actually, I can also get to cisco.com. That makes me slightly suspicious of the (Cisco) firewall. Which, yes, I have twice tried reloading.</p>

<p><strong>6:04 pm</strong><br />
Back home. Today sucked royally. I made three phone calls to Charter, for a total of roughly two hours on the phone. Arguably.</p>

<p>Actually, I only <em>talked</em> to a someone for probably fifteen minutes. But I hear Charter&#8217;s like that.</p>

<p>From the 45-minute hold period on the first call (&#8220;Please hold while I pull up your account information.&#8221;), I concluded that, while classical is nice, it&#8217;s wholly inappropriate when one concerto is looped more than six times. I personally find that demotivating, especially when a new person then picks up the call, tells me that I&#8217;m in the wrong department, says something about transferring, puts me on hold, and drops the call.</p>

<p>This was frustrating, yes, but I only became really infuriated after the second call where I was greeted, unexpectedly put on hold and dropped all within the space of three minutes.</p>

<p>The third call put me in contact with the call center supervisor without too much trouble. I ranted at him for a few minutes which he followed with the textbook &#8220;we&#8217;re sorry for the inconvenience and this isn&#8217;t Charter&#8217;s way of doing business&#8221; mini-speech. Like a well-scripted dance. (I have this mental image of a consumer and a service provider performing ballet, which really isn&#8217;t appropriate. But it does work with the classical hold music.)</p>

<p>Anyway, Eerl (I asked; he&#8217;s from the Philippines. Surprise there.) tried to help me fix the problem. Check that an IP was assigned via <span class=""caps"">DHCP</span>, repair the network connection. He told me to boot to safe mode, and I kind of feel bad for chewing him out for it. I <em>told</em> him that I was dealing with a network-wide problem here; the modem was servicing multiple nodes, not just one PC.</p>

<p>Anyway. He scheduled a rep visit for sometime tomorrow, which I&#8217;ll have to cancel&#8230; Finally realized that if I could ping IPs but not resolve names (I am something of a dolt, yes), and if Charter wasn&#8217;t reporting any problems with our connection, then the problem was somewhere local. The bosses gave me permission to call in someone from One Prospect &#8211; &#8216;Sam&#8217; was the tech who showed up. Nice guy. It took two hours (&#8220;I don&#8217;t know a <span class=""caps"">PIX</span> from crap, I&#8217;m afraid&#8230;&#8221;), but he did find a line in the firewall&#8217;s config that was causing problems.</p>

<p>Which doesn&#8217;t really make sense. The line essentially looped all outward requests back to the local server, which <em>would</em> cause a problem, but didn&#8217;t until 10:00 this morning. At that point, the connection to Charter&#8217;s <span class=""caps"">DNS</span> died, leaving us to run off of cached IPs. (This explains why I could get to ikebowen.com &#8211; still not sure why cisco.com would be cached.) It <em>would</em> make sense had the problem begun immediately after the <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/2007/02/05/what-the"">issues from yesterday</a>, if the config line in question had been removed earlier but not been saved, b/c the <span class=""caps"">PIX</span> box would have rolled back to the saved file with the problematic line in place.</p>

<p>Bah.</p>

<p>Today was the first day in a very long time that I got seriously angry. &#8216;Angry&#8217; meaning &#8216;seriously choleric&#8217;. I don&#8217;t do that very often&#8230; bah. Now I&#8217;m just upset at myself (again) for having to call in a tech to remove a line in the firewall&#8217;s configfile that I could have taken out in fifteen seconds had I found it to be the problem.</p>

<p>[ sighs ] Meh.</p>

<p>Currently, music purchased at Apple Inc.&#8216;s iTunes Store, for example, is wrapped in Apple&#8217;s proprietary version of Digital Rights Management technology known as &#8220;FairPlay&#8221; and can only be played on the company&#8217;s iPod devices. Songs purchased from rival online stores that carry different <span class=""caps"">DRM</span> technology cannot be played on iPods. That has caused some to wonder whether it might be hampering sales.</p>
<p>According to the people familiar with the matter, London-based <span class=""caps"">EMI</span> asked the retailers to submit proposals by Thursday telling the company what size advance payments they would offer in exchange for the right to sell EMI&#8217;s music as MP3s, the Journal reported.</p>
<p>One of the unidentified people said <span class=""caps"">EMI</span> would decide whether to forge ahead with the strategy based on the size of the offers. A decision about whether to keep pursuing the idea could come as soon as Friday, the Journal said.</p>
<p>When asked about the report, <span class=""caps"">EMI</span> spokeswoman Jeanne Meyer told The Associated Press, &#8220;We&#8217;re not commenting on speculation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs called on record labels to abandon their requirement for online music to use <span class=""caps"">DRM</span>, which is designed to limit unauthorized copying. Jobs said such restrictions have done little to slow music piracy and eliminating them would open up the online music marketplace.</p>
<p>One person familiar with the matter told the Journal that several major music companies have recently floated the idea of scrapping copy protections, but none appears to have gone as far as <span class=""caps"">EMI</span>, and some maintain that copy-protection software is critical to stop piracy.</p>
<p><span class=""caps"">EMI</span> is the world&#8217;s third-largest music company by sales and home to acts ranging from The Beatles to the Beastie Boys. But some of its performers &#8211; notably including The Beatles &#8211; do not yet sell their music in any digital form.</p>
<p><span class=""caps"">EMI</span> has experimented with releasing singles in the DRM-free MP3 format. In the past few months, the company has released tracks by Norah Jones, Lily Allen and the band Relient K.</p>
<p>Meyer said Thursday night: &#8220;The results of those experiments were very positive, and the fan feedback has been very enthusiastic.&#8221;</p>

2007-02-11 05:03:14,Saturday (for lack of something better),"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/232.jpg"" /></p>	<p>Today. Spent mostly at work &#8211; left home at seven, got back at four. &#8230; For a Saturday, that&#8217;s far too much time. But what can you do&#8230; We did accomplish a lot. The group&#8217;s in client-reporting mode, which we kind of hit every quarter. For the intern, this means that things become insane for six-ish weeks every three months, while the rest of the time he does useful chores like stock the fridge. Et cetera.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m kind of in a strange state of mind. Methinks it&#8217;s mostly caffeine-induced, as strange as it sounds, combined with not eating. Kind of detached. (Example: my feet are freezing, but I don&#8217;t feel cold.) Hm. Slightly heightened awareness, things move slightly more slowly and can be examined slightly more easily. Bit interesting.</p>

<p>Tried to nap when I got home, went upstairs sometime after four. Conclusion (reached after roughly an hour of trying not to think): caffeine and sleep do not mix. Bah.</p>

<p><strong>addenda</strong> (that <em>is</em> the real plural&#8230; ech.)</p>

<li>I seem to be a National Merit Scholar. Cool.</li>

2007-02-11 21:41:39,Free Will: A Conclusion,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/234.jpg"" /></p>	<p>I&#8217;ve pretty much concluded that free will doesn&#8217;t exist. In an absolute sense. Nothing really points to it, other than the commonly-held belief <em>in</em> it. Brain chemistry to a study of the dimensions &#8211; there&#8217;s no <em>room</em> for free will, God or no. (Though the addition of God makes it a bit more interesting &#8211; he&#8217;s a wildcard with that infinite nature and all.)</p>

<p>So &#8211; free will doesn&#8217;t exist as fact, or so I think I choose to think, but it does have a quasi-existence as a practical illusion, meaning that life seems to be set up as if it existed, giving us the responsibility of choice that we&#8217;d have if free will existed to begin with.</p>

<p>Which more or less renders the entire thought process moot. Bah.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv

<p>These two songs are easily at the top of my list &#8211; #1 and #2, respectively. No question. I&#8217;m waiting for something to fill #3 (and following), but for now these are solid. Both synthpop, yeah. I&#8217;m very&#8230; very <em>attached</em> to that particular genre &#8211; it&#8217;s the only one that really has consistently <em>deep</em> music. Music subtly layered upon itself. Love that.</p>

<p>And, of course, the lyrics work well. Lines I identify with.</p>

<p>Anyway, yeah, enjoy. I think I know two other people who will compulsively listen to this kind of thing because they actually like it, but you might as well listen to them once. Broaden your musical scope and all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to a concentrated marketing effort, Valentine&#8217;s Day has emerged in Japan and Korea as a day on which women, and less commonly men, give candy, chocolate or flowers to people they like. This has become an obligation for many women. Those who work in offices end up giving chocolates to all their male co-workers, sometimes at significant personal expense. This chocolate is known as giri-choko (ç¾©ç†ãƒãƒ§ã‚³), in Japan, from the words giri (&#8220;obligation&#8221;) and choko, a common short version of chokorÄ“to (ãƒãƒ§ã‚³ãƒ¬ãƒ¼ãƒˆ), meaning &#8220;chocolate&#8221;.<br />

<p>If you&#8217;ve never done anything requiring constant mental activity for three hours, you should know straightaway that it&#8217;s a considerable task upon which to embark.</p>

<p>That said, I&#8217;ve been at the Holiday Acres piano since 5:30. Or, well, I&#8217;m back now, but I left at 8:30. &#8230; Oi. They asked me to come back for Valentine&#8217;s Day this year, and my acquiescence belonged firmly in the category of &#8216;shoot, what else can I reasonably say?&#8217;. Ach. But it went well. And no, your hands do not get tired &#8211; just your arms. And right on about 2.5 hours, you start to wonder why there&#8217;s no cushion on the bench.</p>

2007-02-19 05:42:36,A Weekend in the Cities,"<p>Or, <em>Upon the Discovery of 700 Hobo Names</em></p>

<p>For the sake of my own convenience (I was up late, sorry), most of this shall be in list form, usually in chronological order with some un-noted exceptions.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Departure</strong> from <span class=""caps"">RHS</span> at 6:00am, or something close to it. Seven people in the suburban, eight in the minivan. We may be in Decathlon and therefore highly intelligent by association, but logic doesn&#8217;t apply to anything before ten o&#8217;clock.</li>
<li>(<strong>Four hours pass</strong>, briefly interrupted by a Mexican working community, population 176, and it&#8217;s cafÃ©/rest-stop. And also Thorp.)</li>
<li>The <a href=""http://www.artsmia.org/""><strong>Minneapolis Institute of Arts</strong></a>, having no connection to the military acronym (Nathan), was most excellent. Our focus was naturally on the <a href=""http://www.artsmia.org/art%2Dof%2Dasia/"">installation concerning Asia</a>, but the elevator was also fairly diverting. It was the sort that one would expect in a theatre complex from the late 1920&#8217;s, actually, and had a manual door.</li>
<li><strong>The Mall of America.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Food.</strong> This was at the time a matter of particular importance, and for reason of the same gets its own subsection. Even if my pizza was cold.</li>
<li><strong>Gamestop</strong> &#8211; I think Will was looking for a game (would make sense). I ended up with the Matrix trilogy in its multiple-disc-widescreen-special-edition entirety for less than 20usd (!!).</li>
<li><strong>Various Other Stores</strong>, not deserving of their own individual subsections, but including such as Sox Appeal and Sam Goody (the clerks there were very suspicious of my Gamestop bag&#8217;s contents, which set off the merch alarm no less than twice).</li>
<li><strong>Barnes & Noble.</strong> I think I could live a fairly pleasant existence at any given Barnes & Noble without ever leaving, but my current income wouldn&#8217;t support that. And neither would the Mall&#8217;s security staff.
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.areasofmyexpertise.com/""><strong>The Areas of My Expertise</strong></a>, an almanac by none other than <a href=""http://areasofmyexpertise.blogspot.com/"">John Hodgman</a> (you may know him from the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_a_Mac"">Get a Mac ads</a> or the <a href=""http://www.littlegraybooks.com/"">Little Gray Book Lectures</a>, depending on your social life). This book has proved to be possibly my best purchase from the weekend (excluding a bamboo stalk and two bottles of Bawls, but I&#8217;ll get to that). Excepting the Bible, and perhaps the life&#8217;s work of Douglas Adams, this is truly the only book you ever will need. Or the first third, I suppose, for two additional compendiums of world knowledge are on their way and continue the page numbering from where the respective predecessor left off. It has nearly everything going for it, including a plug from the High Priest from the Church of Satan (I do not lie). I expect I&#8217;ll cover the book in more detail later, but I was intrigued at finding within the book a significant reference to the precise Barnes & Noble location from which I made the purchase. <em>&#8220;Coincidence?&#8221;</em> (The book, by the way, includes 700 hobo names &#8211; all of these, curiously, have been illustrated at <a href=""http://e-hobo.com/"">e-hobo.com</a>.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ikea.</strong> <em>What</em> a great store, and I&#8217;m killing myself for not posting photos right now. Ranks right up there next to Barnes & Noble, not only for the cutting boards arranged in the art-deco style, but also for the reasonably-priced meatballs. I purchased two table-lamps, and also a bamboo stalk.</li>
<li><strong>Hotel.</strong> A few interesting incidents, including a malfunctioning pool door. <em>And</em> sleep, which isn&#8217;t really interesting, but worthy of note.</li>
<li><strong>Departure</strong> from hotel. We stopped at the nearest Holiday station for a caffeine fix, where I discovered that that particular Holiday station is among the happy and tireless few that stock <a href=""http://bawls.com/"">Bawls</a>, energy drink of the gods. And the poor caffeine addicts of Prentice High &#8211; ask me sometime.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m home now. And exhausted. I&#8217;m working on ripping the Matrix films in a Zune-friendly format, but my computer has lost its grip on the normal flow of time and logic.</p>

<p>Goodnight.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv
2007-02-21 05:00:25,An Assortment,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/251.jpg"" /></p>	<p><strong>Google search tracking</strong><br />
My Google homepage (the <a href=""http://google.com/ig"">google.com/ig</a> one; I have yet to figure out what &#8216;ig&#8217; stands for) shows me what Google thinks I would find interest in, given what I&#8217;ve searched for in the past. It bothers me that a full 20% of the recommendations are in Russian.</p>

<p><strong>The Prestige</strong><br />
It out on <span class=""caps"">DVD</span>! Ha! Walmart and Circuit City have the lowest prices, excluding any applicable shipping. And then there&#8217;s <a href=""http://search.ebay.com/the-prestige-dvd_W0QQfrppZ50QQfsopZ1QQmaxrecordsreturnedZ300QQsatitleZQ22theQ20prestigeQ22Q20dvd"">eBay</a>. Interestingly, Google recommends the search query &#8220;the prestige torrent&#8221;, entirely of its own accord.</p>

<p><strong>Passport photos</strong><br />
Another way that Walmart screws America. 10usd for a manually-trimmed Polaroid?</p>

<p><strong>Godaddy</strong><br />
Yes, their advertising is despicable. But they&#8217;re cheap. Use the code &#8216;gdd0129d&#8217; to purchase/renew/transfer .com domains for 6.95usd. I&#8217;m unsure if the pricing holds for future renewals.</p>

<p><strong>1st Financial Bank</strong><br />
Mail-spam. A ploy against the innocent (here meaning &#8216;naive&#8217;) college student. The back of the letter is the embodiment of the archetypal fine print &#8211; the stuff at the top is large and the stuff at the bottom is minuscule. And even if the student in question gets to pick his/her own background graphic (interesting that the only state flags available are for Illinois, Texas, Ohio, NY and California; also that the zodiac paintings each have an &#174; in the actual painting), an apr that goes up by 19.95 percentage points for balances over $250 is ridiculous.</p>

<p>It is nice, though, that they include a letter to the parents to console them about their child having a <em>credit card</em>, of all things. Even if the closing reads &#8220;1sr Financial Bank&#8221;.</p>

This does not constitute an unauthorized reproduction of said book, as I have spelled certain words incorrectly and shall conclude by asking you to purchase the book, which justifies my purpose.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Third of Six Oaths of the Virtuous Child</strong><br />
I shall be a faithful chile, and I shall ever make science my enemy. Also eels.</p>

<p><strong>Hobo Name #691</strong><br />
Undertaker Robert, the Lint-Coffin Weaver</p>

<p><strong>A Selection of Debated Planats</strong><br />
Neptune: The residents of its thirteen mooons believe religously that Neptune itself doesn&#8217;t exist. When they purify it from their minds, the &#8220;Great Blue Insult&#8221; shall dissapear.<br />
Jupiter: Possibly just a moon of the largest planit, Gigantor.<br />
Super-Gigantor: A hypothetical mass designed to annoy Jupiter.<br />
Mercury: Zero axal tilt? Please. Most agree that this is either a space station or a self-aware supercomputer.</p>

<p><strong>North Dakota</strong><br />
Motto: &#8220;Liberty and Union, Now and Forevah, One and Inseparable, Except for South Dakota.&#8221;<br />
Notes: Since its seccession from South Dakota in 1941, North Dakota has sought a unique identity for itself, largely through the yearly commissioning of random new nicknemes, including &#8220;The Soo State,&#8221; &#8220;The Flickertail State,&#8221; &#8220;The Peace Garden State,&#8221; &#8220;The Birthplace of the Macabre,&#8221; and &#8220;The South Dakota of the North.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Three of Nine Presidents Who Had Hooks for Hands</strong><br />
The association of hooks with pirates begans with J. M. Barrieeee, author of <em>Peter Pan</em>, whose &#8220;Captain Hook popularized the still-seductive concept of extreemely sharp, largely useless seafaring prosthetics. In fact, though, it cannot be proven that any nonfictional pirate ever replaced his hand with a hook.</p>

<p>Jifferson (who designed his own hook)<br />
T. Roosevelt (first draft: &#8220;speak softly and pierce their eyes with a golden hook&#8221;)<br />
F. Roosevelt (note: his hook was actually a wheelchair)</p>

It is even endorsed by the High Priest of the Church of Satan, which is not a lie. I leave you with the following book rating/blurb, and its accuracy rating by the book&#8217;s author:</p>

&#8220;The flat-out funniest book of the year. IT&#8217;S <span class=""caps"">IMPOSSIBLE</span> TO <span class=""caps"">DISLIKE</span>. So comprehensive (and so blastedly funny) that you may never read another almanac again.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Source</strong><br />
The Virginian-Pilot<br />
<strong>Accuracy</strong><br />
86%. Some scientists have proven via a thought expiriment that it is, under certain conditions, possible to dislike this booke. If you wish to tri it at home, the experiment requires this book, a box, a cat inside the box, a canister of poisonous gas, and the willingness to kill the cat for the sake of a mere thought experimente. I hope you are satisfied, monster.</p>

<p><span class=""caps"">MIT</span> hasn&#8217;t received my transcript yet. I asked the guidance office to send it in a month ago&#8230; they didn&#8217;t. Meh. That was probably in some way, shape or form my fault &#8211; they were under the impression that there was something that had to be added to it. [ shakes head ] Ah well. It went in the mail on Friday, but hasn&#8217;t been processed yet in Cambridge. I&#8217;m slightly nervous.</p>

<p>And in 17 days I&#8217;ll find out if I&#8217;m to be on the east coast this time next year. And whether or not I&#8217;ll leave school with several not insignificant student loans. Whether I&#8217;ll be as far away from home, alone, as I&#8217;ve ever been before, and whether or not I&#8217;ll be at a school that looks like an extension of my mind (in principle) or at a product of public education.</p>

<p>Though I suppose it&#8217;s hard to argue that it&#8217;s worth worrying about. The decisions have probably already been all but made, with or without my fairly tardy transcript. (I&#8217;ve decided as of now to also have it faxed in, assuming that school isn&#8217;t canceled tomorrow.) And, if I&#8217;m correct about free will, &#8230; no, if I&#8217;m correct, my opinion doesn&#8217;t matter. Never mind.</p>

<p>Forgot to complete a workpacket for calc, docking my grade by 35 points. Ah well.</p>

<p>Decathlon essay test is tomorrow &#8211; it&#8217;ll be something on climatology. Hopefully not too much emphasis on China; I don&#8217;t think I could make any sort of quality argument with the two combined.</p>

Only mirrors stay by my side,<br />
Only showing an empty shell.</p>
<p>An empty shell is all that&#8217;s left,<br />
Feels like the rest has drained away.<br />
There was nothing of value to keep it there,<br />
No reason why it should stay.</p>
<p>And on I walk through an eternity,<br />
My reflection and I alone,<br />
Without any hope of any escape<br />
From a hall of mirror and stone.</p>

2007-03-05 06:56:35,A Purpose for Living,"<p>If a species is to survive, it must have a drive to do so. Yes, this is stating the obvious. There is no reasonably sane buffalo that wants to die (not that enough of them haven&#8217;t died already).</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s interesting that suicide rates are, over the long-term, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide#_ref-8"">rising</a>. It&#8217;s possible, of course, that other causes of death are being diminished. Fewer people in the United States have been killed in land-wars than ever before, for example.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s still fundamentally bothersome that 2003 saw suicide to be the eighth leading cause of death for US males, and while men are more likely to actually kill themselves than women, women make the attempt three times as often. (Or say they do.) (<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/suifacts.htm"">ref</a>)</p>

<p>And forget men as a whole &#8211; suicide is the third leading cause of death for youth. <em>Youth,</em> defined in the study as those between 15 and 24. The young people, the ones supposed to be full of promise with their whole lives ahead of them, commit suicide more often than their elders. (<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/suifacts.htm"">ref</a>)</p>

<p>That&#8217;s <em>terrible</em>. And totally against animal instincts. While the connection there might be a stretch (there are neurotic deer who will simply stare into the headlights, waiting for their undoing), the fact that 10 out of 100k Americans kill themselves is <em>still</em> appalling. (<a href=""http://isaacbowen.com/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate"">ref</a>)</p>

<p>So why is this happening?</p>

<p>People kill themselves for a variety of reasons, I&#8217;m sure, though I&#8217;ve not spoken with anyone yet who has committed suicide after speaking to me. (&#8230;) Other obscure reasons aside, I&#8217;ll willingly conjecture that it&#8217;s simply a depression so deep and dark that a person honestly doesn&#8217;t believe their life is worth living. They have no <em>reason</em> to live, nothing to live <em>for</em>.</p>

<p>So. Given that rates are going up, if slowly, is it reasonable to say that people are losing grip more often? More people have nothing to live for? Nothing to anchor themselves to, no concrete assurance that they are indeed worth something?</p>

<p>And what might that say about humanity?</p>

<p>I told myself I wasn&#8217;t going to spend anything more until Madison. Nothing more &#8211; State Street will be bad enough, and I don&#8217;t even <em>have</em> my meh shirt yet.</p>

<p>It seems that I don&#8217;t have quite the resolve I thought I had. Either that, or coffee now holds sway over my soul.</p>

<p>But, regardless of that, it does seem to be Thursday. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t even be freaking Friday!&#8221;, as a co-worker aptly put it&#8230; The week is crawling. It felt long on <del>Tuesday</del> <a href=""http://hook.freetxp.com/2007/02/26/threesday"">Threesday</a>, though it is some comfort that we&#8217;ll be doing absolutely nothing in Calc through Friday.

I think I&#8217;ve said this before, but it&#8217;s weird how people that you&#8217;ve known for only a week can be some of the best friends you&#8217;ve had. <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/?q=riley"">Riley</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Dylan&#8217;s tryout for Sound of Music is this afternoon. I dearly hope that I won&#8217;t screw up the accompaniment&#8230; The Point of No Return, from Phantom &#8211; lots of full/straight diminished chords all in a row. It&#8217;s the kind of score that you can&#8217;t really think about; just go straight through it or you&#8217;ll miss something, and you&#8217;re thinking through the music anyway, you&#8217;ll get distracted wondering how F minor and A major are supposed to sound good together.

<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t do senior pictures, and I&#8217;m not sure if I will yet or not. And&#8230; I think that&#8217;s mostly because I&#8217;m not sure I want to be remembered.</p>

<p>Not that, you know, high school friendships generally last very long. You keep up with a couple people, maybe. But people are, by and large, replaceable.</p>

<p>And&#8230; yeah, that sounds cynical. But think about it. The divorce stats over the last decade prove the point. Marriage is supposed to be a promise to stick with this one presumably special person for the rest of your <em>life</em>.</p>

<p><!-- But - senior pics. I've tried a couple home-grown ones, a couple of which I liked, but most not. There's a visible trend in the okay-ish shots - my face is largely obscured. The focus is on the composition, the lighting, the mood. I want to convey _me_, not necessarily my visible self. --></p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m picking this up after several days. You know what it feels like to be screaming on the inside without any way to let that out? Like railing at reality for <em>being</em>?</p>

<p>Anthony asked <a href=""http://hook.freetxp.com/2007/03/14/untitled"">the question</a> the other day &#8211; is ignorance/bliss better than awareness/&#8230;not-bliss?</p>

<p>My first and immediate reaction was yes. Yes, it&#8217;s better not to experience the bad, even at the sacrifice of the good.</p>

<p>My second and immediately following reaction was a double-take. Probably because I second-guess everything I say, though perhaps there&#8217;s some vestige of the optimist left.</p>

<p>Smith/Oracle: Why, Mr. Anderson, why? Why, why do you do it? Why, why get up? Why keep fighting? Do you believe you&#8217;re fighting for something, for more than your survival? Can you tell me what it is, do you even know? Is it freedom or truth, perhaps peace &#8211; could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson, vagaries of perception. Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose. And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself. Although, only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson, you must know it by now! You can&#8217;t win, it&#8217;s pointless to keep fighting! Why, Mr. Anderson, why, why do you persist?</p>

Received the rejection letter today. Well, no, that&#8217;s not accurate. It was more of a non-acceptance letter than anything.</p>

<p>Which I&#8217;m okay with, actually. (Firefox doesn&#8217;t think &#8220;okay&#8221; is a word.) More or less chose to expect this, so it wasn&#8217;t a shocker by any means. That, and I still hold confidence in Rom8:28.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m thinking UW Madison for next year. I don&#8217;t feel a huge desire to go there, but still no less than for any other school. And Madison&#8217;s range of offerings should give me an idea of what to do with the next three years of college thereafter.</p>

<p>Econ. Meh.</p>

<p>To introduce the role of government in private life, Nelson presented a few statements. Marijuana use should be legalized; a smoking ban in public places should be instated. Really agree, agree, disagree, really disagree.</p>

<p>Welfare should not be a government service &#8211; it should be provided by private organizations. Strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree?</p>

<p>Most disagreed on that one, a few agreed. My general line of thinking was that welfare is guaranteed for those who need it, while it remains a government-backed, tax-funded service. If it was left to private organizations, there wouldn&#8217;t be any such guarantee.</p>

<p>After stating this, someone on the &#8216;agree&#8217; (an odd word, come to think of it) end of the room expressed their astonishment that we disagree-ers didn&#8217;t believe that enough people would step up to charity, that enough funding <em>could</em> be raised to give welfare to those who needed it.</p>

<p>I think the statement was, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that you don&#8217;t think people would care enough&#8230;&#8221; Something like. Paraphrase.</p>

<p>And I don&#8217;t, honestly. If people cared enough, more than 24% of Ethiopians would have drinking water. (<a href=""http://www.unicef.org/specialsession/about/sgreport-pdf/03_SafeDrinkingWater_D7341Insert_English.pdf"">ref</a>)</p>

<p>The agree-ers seemed to think that people as a whole are <em>good</em> enough to support those who need it. Which then raises the argument, are people fundamentally good or evil? (I hesitated to write &#8216;evil&#8217;. &#8230; Strange.) What say you?</p>

<p><strong>addendum</strong><br />
I generally avoid reprinting offsite links (the ones down and to the right) in articles, but this you really must see. Have you heard of <a href=""http://desktopography.net/""><strong>Desktopography</strong></a>?

2007-03-19 15:21:51,mp3_xml,"<p>So &#8211; Anthony pointed out the other day that a tool to parse the <span class=""caps"">XSPF</span> (<span class=""caps"">XML</span> Shareable Playlist Format) files from those Myspace music players could be handy. Pull out the song name and file <span class=""caps"">URL</span>, and away we go.</p>

<p>Thusly, <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/mp3_xml.php""><strong>mp3_xml</strong></a>. (Misnamed, yes.) Plug in an <span class=""caps"">XSPF</span> <span class=""caps"">URL</span> and it gives you a list of songs with links to download from, including a list of only URLs for use in something like Wackget. I put the sourcecode below &#8211; it could be better written, but this works. And I haven&#8217;t written a random short script for obscure and potentially dubious purposes in a <em>long</em> time.</p>

<p><a href=""http://projectplaylist.com"">ProjectPlaylist</a> made XSPF-based players popular. ... It can&#8217;t be legal. You can type in any of a million song names into the search box and download the file a second later. ...</p>

<p>Ah well. For the time being, it&#8217;s fun. And it&#8217;s not like the Myspace hordes aren&#8217;t downloading their music illegally anyway.</p>

2007-03-21 15:59:16,SDR Graduation,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/306.jpg"" /></p>	<p>Situation: <acronym title=""Northwoods Community Secondary School"">NCSS</acronym> has reached its third year of existence, and is out from under the provisions of its first two years, where graduates were given an <span class=""caps"">RHS</span> diploma and guaranteed the option to participate in the <span class=""caps"">RHS</span> graduation ceremony. That being said, there are two graduating seniors at <span class=""caps"">NCSS</span> that want to march in this year&#8217;s <span class=""caps"">RHS</span> graduation.</p>

<p>Their situation is understandable &#8211; they both spent most of their secondary years <em>at</em> <span class=""caps"">RHS</span>, and have spent the greater portion of 12 education years with students now at <span class=""caps"">RHS</span>. It&#8217;s only natural that they&#8217;d want to stand next to their peers at the graduation ceremony in June. And if it&#8217;s only two, is it such a big deal?</p>

<p>It rather is, mostly because it&#8217;s a question of precedence (what happens next year, when there are more <span class=""caps"">NCSS</span> graduates?), but also because of the die-hard <span class=""caps"">RHS</span> loyalists who want no trace of other school district schools in the graduation ceremony.</p>

<p>As I see it, the only real issue is one of name. If it&#8217;s a Rhinelander High School ceremony, it makes <em>no</em> sense for any non-<span class=""caps"">RHS</span> graduates to participate. It just doesn&#8217;t. Incongruency.</p>

<p>The option is there, of course, to declare it an <acronym title=""School District of Rhinelander"">SDR</acronym> Ceremony, and make it all-inclusive &#8211; allowing all <span class=""caps"">SDR</span> graduates to participate.</p>

<p>Aside from home-team passion, there&#8217;s no real argument against this. There was never a problem with it being an RHS-only ceremony in the past (well, more than three years ago), as <span class=""caps"">RHS</span> was the only secondary institution in the District. Now that there <em>is</em>, who&#8217;s to say that there shouldn&#8217;t be a District-wide ceremony?</p>

<p>No, there doesn&#8217;t have to be. <span class=""caps"">NCSS</span> already has their own ceremony, after all, scheduled this year for the 5th of June.</p>

<p>But then, <span class=""caps"">RHS</span> also has an awards ceremony, scheduled this year for the 23rd of May. If this is held comparable to NCSS&#8217;s ceremony, then why not take RHS&#8217;s actual graduation exercises and expand them beyond <span class=""caps"">RHS</span> itself? That&#8217;s not unreasonable.</p>

<p>There is also, however, the question of <span class=""caps"">SDR</span> policy. This was raised in a meeting this week with Ms. Machtan from <span class=""caps"">NCSS</span>, Mr. Werbowsky (<span class=""caps"">RHS</span> principal) and the <span class=""caps"">RHS</span> Council officers. <span class=""caps"">SDR</span> Policy 5459 (which can be found <a href=""http://rhinelander.k12.wi.us/Policies/5000-Students.pdf"">online</a>) states the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span class=""caps"">PARTICIPATION</span> IN <span class=""caps"">THE</span> <span class=""caps"">GRADUATION</span> CEREMONY</strong></p>
<p>Except for extenuating circumstances and prior approval of the Superintendent, as the Board&#8217;s agent, a student must<br />
have met all requirements for graduation in order to participate in graduation exercises.</p>
<p>[ &#8220;extenuating circumstances&#8221; listed here ]</p>
<p>A student will not be permitted to participate in graduation ceremonies if he/she has outstanding fees, fines, and/or<br />
behavioral/disciplinary consequences remaining to be satisfied.</p>
<p>The administration will make a reasonable effort to inform the student and parent(s) or guardian(s) of any student<br />
who is ineligible to participate in the graduation ceremony. Individuals may appeal their individual circumstances to<br />
the administration for review.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was argued that this policy guarantees the option to participate in a District-wide ceremony for all those eligible (<span class=""caps"">NCSS</span> students are held to the same District graduation requirements as those at <span class=""caps"">RHS</span>, btw). This interpretation is arguable, as the policy was approved when only one high school existed and might expand to cover additional high schools as they are incepted, resulting in a multi-school graduation ceremony.</p>

<p>I personally don&#8217;t interpret the policy as such. From an email conversation concerning the policy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... it doesn&#8217;t seem that such a guarantee is made at all, nor is a single, all-inclusive graduation ceremony mentioned. In fact, while 5459 requires that a student &#8220;must have met all requirements for graduation in order to participate in graduation exercises&#8221; (except for extenuating circumstances, etc), 5459 seems only to state the disqualifications for participation in &#8220;graduation exercises&#8221; (rather than, say, &#8220;the District&#8217;s graduation ceremony&#8221;).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So &#8211; where does this leave us? This entire argument seems like overkill for this year&#8217;s two <span class=""caps"">NCSS</span> grads (clarification: the two wishing to participate in the <span class=""caps"">RHS</span> graduation), but again, this is a question of precedence. Do we go to a District-wide graduation ceremony? Or leave it per-school? Does policy 5459 apply to this situation, and if so, <em>must</em> a District-wide ceremony be created? Or should <span class=""caps"">RHS</span> keep its awards night and expand its graduation exercises to cover all <span class=""caps"">SDR</span> schools?</p>

<p>What say you?</p>

<p>&#8220;The Leviathan&#8221;, in this context, is a Compaq ProLiant ML370.

<p>Why have I done this? The higher-ups wish to know if there are any parts that can be salvaged.</p>

<p>Foolishly, I thought that I could simply boot the machine up and find out everything from within the OS. Silly me. NT doesn&#8217;t <em>have</em> a device manager. (Which, for a system that can&#8217;t actually shut itself off, is understandable.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure what to think about that. I haven&#8217;t taken sides in this, I swear I haven&#8217;t. What I wrote was from a neutral point of view, arguing <em>both</em> (count them: two) sides of the situation.

<p>Oh, no. With a <span class=""caps"">BIOS</span> &#169;1982, the <em>Pre</em>-Leviathan has been maintaining homeostasis for longer than anyone seems to remember, having established symbiosis with the shredder <em>years</em> ago.</p>

<p><em>Spinning <span class=""caps"">SCSI</span> Hard Drives&#8230;</em></p>

<p>Interestingly, the PLev is significantly quieter than its successor. This is probably because its processor runs at 166MHz and doesn&#8217;t need the cooling systems that The Leviathan does.</p>

<p><strong>addendum</strong><br />
I detest recording off of a digital piano. It&#8217;s not <em>real</em>. And normally non-real things don&#8217;t bother me, but in this instance it does. For example, as it&#8217;s a work of precision electrical and mechanical engineering, it is perfectly and consistently in tune. This annoys me.</p>

<p>Possibly because I&#8217;m in love with the dear old (&#8220;old&#8221; here meaning &#8220;at least a century in age&#8221;) piano sitting quietly in the corner of the parlor. It is decidedly <em>not</em> in tune, and would probably make any virtuoso cry.</p>

<p><em>But</em>. But. <em>But</em>, you can <em>feel</em> it. Play your heart out on it. Use the imperfections as nuances in musick. Make the keys extensions of your hands, knowing each piece of chipped and worn ivory like a part of yourself, listening to and feeling the sound wash back over you. I love this. It&#8217;s something that a digital simply cannot accomplish.</p>

<p>I took the two themes from the music up above and wandered through them again on ye olde upright. It means&#8230; means so <em>much</em> more with that instrument. I want to have it sampled some day, save every piece of the sound and have the piano with me wherever I end up, if only as a reminder of the times I&#8217;ve spent with it. Him. Her. The music.</p>

<p>Do you know what it feels like (and now I&#8217;m rambling) to fully and completely express your soul? To take everything that you feel, everything inside of you, and to let it all out in a medium that completely fits who and what you are.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s pointless, of course. No practical value.</p>

(Or one could argue that only the optimist really means that, whereas the pessimist is simply bitter at the contents for showing up the void in the first place.)</p>

<p>From the cynic&#8217;s point of view, however, this is an exercise in futility. The glass is half full (or empty, whichever), but in all practicality it&#8217;s just twice as big as it need be. The cynic would go on to say that the rest of the glass is just a waste of space. Unless you go for the aesthetic ying-yang universal balance of things, the second half has no purpose.</p>

<p>Siding with the cynic for the time being, the optimist and the pessimist seem to be deluding themselves. The glass could hold as much as it holds again, true, but it&#8217;s a waste of time to expect that. Or even treat it as a possibility. As far as reality is concerned, the rest of the glass is superfluous &#8211; only misleading the romantics who want to think that the glass might some day hold more than it does now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Optimist: <em>But hey, the glass</em> could <em>be half full.</em></p>
<p>Pessimist: <em>... It isn&#8217;t.</em></p>
<p>Cynic: <em>For today, and as far as anyone is concerned, forever, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.</em></p>

2007-04-01 04:04:09,Illinois Institute of Technology,"<p><span class=""caps"">IIT</span> sent me an email a while back exhorting me to apply. The application in question being both short and, more importantly, free, I applied. The acceptance letter came some weeks thereafter.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t give a whole lot of thought to the school, and haven&#8217;t until&#8230; yesterday. The application was free, and the word &#8220;technology&#8221; was in the school&#8217;s name. But, what the heck &#8211; I sent a copy of my <span class=""caps"">FAFSA</span> to them, along with my <span class=""caps"">ACT</span>/SAT scores. Didn&#8217;t cost me anything, and it gave me a school to fall back on in the event that both UW Madison and Northwestern College abruptly blew up. One never really knows.</p>

<p>But I found a financial aid award letter in the mail the other day, with quite a generous offering contained therein. Better, actually, than Northwestern&#8217;s offer, bringing the cost of attending such a school down below what Madison is likely to give me.</p>

<p>And so, the school research process begins again. <span class=""caps"">IIT</span> seems to be a slightly lesser version of <span class=""caps"">MIT</span>, situated on the southern end of Lake Michigan. (I now know which lake is Superior and which is Michigan &#8211; a momentous occasion.) It has a substantial engineering program, but I&#8217;m eying the Institute of Design for the long run. Maybe get a Bachelor&#8217;s in compsci and go to the design school for a Master&#8217;s.</p>

<p>This is all speculation at the moment, but methinks we&#8217;ll visit the campus during Spring Break. The aid award letter was completely unexpected (in both its arrival and contents), and&#8230; hm. God does weird things like this on occasion, and it&#8217;s entirely possible that I&#8217;ll end up in Chicago next year. Oddly enough.</p>

<p>Like a photographer. Finding a flawless subject in perfect light, waiting for the right moment to snap the frame. Taking the shot, only to find it imperfect. Not by a lot, and you could probably ignore what&#8217;s wrong. What&#8217;s missing. But if you had moved a little to the left, waited another moment for the shadows to deepen, it might have been right.</p>

<p>Like that, if that makes sense.</p>

<p><em>If I sing you a song, will you sing along?</em></p>

<p>Trying to think of a word for this. Like bittersweet, but mostly sweet. A moment that was nearly right, but you saw it coming. Saw it coming and tried to accommodate it &#8211; make the right moves, say the right things, but you tried too hard. Saw the chance for perfection and watched yourself overshoot.</p>

<p>Or, conversely, not going far enough. Waiting for the moment to effloresce of its own accord, to bring itself to <em>right</em>ness, only to find that it couldn&#8217;t go far enough on its own.</p>

<p><em>If I tell you Iâ€™m strong, will you play along?</em></p>

<p>Not that that really leaves anyone anywhere, but&#8230; gah. I can&#8217;t decide. Whether it&#8217;s better to have that taste of perfection, of complete and inherent near-rightness, or to leave it alone and move on. The classic question, I imagine. <em>To be, or not to be?</em></p>

<p><em>... or should I just keep singing right here by myself?</em></p>

2007-04-10 07:28:15,,"<p>Driving back from Chicago, we stopped at a highway construction site outside of Stevens Point. My grandparents live on some land off 51, and the DOT&#8217;s requisitioned a parcel of it for roadway expansion.</p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t effect me personally much; I&#8217;ve not been able to empathize with their frustration. But my dad&#8217;s reaction to what they&#8217;d done to the land&#8230; I think changed that.</p>

<p>He grew up there, see. He was my brother&#8217;s age, hunting with <em>his</em> dad in the woods. Getting the first deer and all that. Memories. To see the forest where he spent his childhood, now razed to the ground and in piles&#8230; I can&#8217;t imagine.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ground over here is rocky &#8211; we weren&#8217;t able to do a whole lot with it. Didn&#8217;t have the equipment to clean it out or get over the rocks. The machines they have now can do it easily, but with the little tractors&#8230; I built a road there. Took dad&#8217;s tractor through the woods and used the claw in the back to scrape the ground. There was a lever, around at the back, and I made a path around the rocks, scraping the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a road. It wasn&#8217;t nearly as random as it might sound. He&#8217;s standing there, remembering the effort he put into a path through the trees with the equipment at hand. Spending hours on it. And now watching the Ponssees tear through the ground like water, erasing memories with hydraulic precision and power.</p>

<p>Because it&#8217;s not the land, so much. It&#8217;s remembering what you did there, and what it took to pull it off. Remembering what you made your life of, and then seeing the machine that is the world tear it into pieces, fueling someone else&#8217;s next step forward.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv
2007-04-11 06:37:08,Two Rivers,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/377.jpg"" /></p>	<blockquote>
<p>Trees line the quiet streets of Two Rivers, an all-American city thatâ€™s surrounded on three sides by majestic Lake Michigan. In the center of town, gracious old buildings frame Central Park, where young and old alike gather for festivals or just to sit and talk. Customers shop at well-kept stores and are greeted with friendly smiles, while modern factories provide economic stability to the community and offer a secure lifestyle. Throughout the city, visitors can find comfortable, well-appointed lodging and restaurants that serve every kind of fare, from fast food to gourmet meals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never mind what the <a href=""http://www.ci.two-rivers.wi.us/"">official site</a> says, my cousins live there. &#8216;Tis enough.</p>

<p>We spent Easter and the day before with a branch of the family that I haven&#8217;t seen for some time. Two Rivers is up the Lake Michigan coast from Manitowoc and south of a town cleverly named &#8220;Two Creeks&#8221;.</p>

<p>So. We met up with most of the group at the theatre. It&#8217;s an actual performance venue, and several of the area churches had rented it for something like the 34th annual Resurrection Celebration play (this year subtitled &#8220;Broken For You&#8221;). It was&#8230; really an excellent production. My uncle portrayed the Christ. Powerfully done.</p>

<p>The Easter service the next day was also at the theatre, simply to hold the people that come. Again, an excellent service. Inspired. The salvation offer was presented at one point. Honestly, one of the coolest things I&#8217;ve ever seen is a person taking a step towards God.</p>

2007-04-14 18:32:14,IIT,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/383.jpg"" /></p>	<p>Right, it&#8217;s been awhile. And I still haven&#8217;t said anything about <span class=""caps"">IIT</span>. Ergo:</p>

<p>We (meaning my dad and I) visited the Illinois Institute of Technology on Monday. The itinerary was fairly basic &#8211; meeting with an admissions counselor, and a campus tour. Lunch on the house.</p>

<p>It became rather more interesting directly upon our arrival to the campus, when we realized that neither of us had a map or any idea of where to park. After paying for parking in one of the several lots marked &#8220;Visitors&#8221;, an affable-ish black security guard (who fulfilled every one of the stereotypes that are running through your head &#8211; I&#8217;m sorry) pointed us in the direction of the main building.</p>

<p>Now, the main building houses a few different things, and the only one of immediate interest seemed to be the financial aid office. Somehow the secretary decided that we should have a meeting with a financial aid counselor (I still don&#8217;t know why&#8230; all we wanted was the admissions office), but I fortunately found a spot to print off the email from whoever had set up our visit. To Perlstein Hall we go.</p>

<p>Sparing you the details from the admissions meeting, I will say that my impression was very favorable. <span class=""caps"">IIT</span> is no <span class=""caps"">MIT</span>, but if you cut <span class=""caps"">MIT</span> roughly in half and slapped it in the midwest, it might come close. And they have an Internet Communication major. What&#8217;s not to like?</p>

<p>On to the tour:</p>

<p>All in all&#8230; hrm. I like this school. And I think I&#8217;d feel good about going here. Which is significant &#8211; I felt no such thing for either <acronym title=""Northwestern College""><span class=""caps"">NWC</span></acronym> or Madison.</p>

2007-04-16 02:38:07,AllofMP3,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/391.jpg"" /></p>	<p><em>AllOfMP3.com is an online music store based in Moscow, Russia which was founded in 2000 by Mediaservices, Inc. The store sells music encoded in standard, non-protected audio formats at a significantly lower cost than other online music stores.</em> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AllOfMP3.com"">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

<p>Now, I love this site. I used it for months. When you can buy music for .10usd each, you appease the part of you that doesn&#8217;t want to steal music outright while satisfying the other half that doesn&#8217;t want to spend 40% of your income on x albums.</p>

<p>That said, I miss using the site. It beats eMusic, iTunes and the rest hands-down for site design, catalog scope, price and usability. And it doesn&#8217;t force fricking <span class=""caps"">DRM</span> onto everything that&#8217;s purchased.</p>

<p>But while you save 90-odd cents by using the site, there is an ethical cost. No money is paid to the labels that fund the artists. AllofMP3 <em>does</em> pay royalties to <acronym title=""the Russian Organization for Multimedia and Digital Services"">ROMS</acronym>, but this Russian entity isn&#8217;t generally recognized by record labels. The by-the-book workaround to this is straightforward: when a US visitor purchases a track from the AllofMP3 catalog, they import it from a foreign country for personal use. This, technically, is legal.</p>

<p>But ethically? As far as I know, all that the site owners have to do is purchase albums, rip the music for the encoders to use, and rake in $30 million every year from the people sick of iTunes and the <span class=""caps"">RIAA</span> (<a href=""http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=17746_0_2_0_C"">source</a>).</p>

<p>Oh, yes, the <span class=""caps"">RIAA</span>. Now, aside from their efforts to eliminate <a href=""http://www.riaa.com/issues/piracy/identificationbrochure.pdf"">counterfeit CDs</a> (<a href=""http://www.mpaa.org/MPAA_Poster_22x32_FINAL.pdf"">MPAA-style</a>), they&#8217;ve ticked off quite a few people. 531 individuals offering music on file-sharing networks were nailed in the <a href=""http://www.riaa.com/news/newsletter/021704.asp"">last round</a> of lawsuits. Yet, for all that the <span class=""caps"">RIAA</span> seems to have the music industry&#8217;s blessing, some still believe that the <span class=""caps"">RIAA</span> and its ilk will meet there doom. EMI&#8217;s dismissal of <span class=""caps"">DRM</span> in their iTunes catalog is a positive sign for those hoping a future with less <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairPlay"">FairPlay</a> <em>and</em> Limewire.</p>

<p>There isn&#8217;t a whole lot more to say here, as volumes have been written elsewhere on this subject and everything connected to it. Bringing &#8216;er back around to AllofMP3, though (I&#8217;m getting offtopic and haven&#8217;t really made a point yet), let me share with you this exchange from the <a href=""http://blogs.allofmp3.com/allofmp3/2006/12/26/allofmp3-response-to-complaint-by-major-record-labels/"">AllofMP3 blogs</a>:</p>

Why are people so resistant to change. Change is good. If millions of people are visiting and using Allofmp3, why not figure out why it is so successful? In addition to the low prices, there are additional features and musical selections that other sites do not offer (iTunes) that attract me to the site. Please keep up the good work Allofmp3 and I hope the <span class=""caps"">RIAA</span> realizes that the youth are going to rise up against it (your days are numbered).......</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope the <span class=""caps"">RIAA</span> realizes that the youth are going to rise up against â€¦&#8221; Yeah right Wes, dream on dude. So you come from America right. And what percentage vote in elections in your country? Fifty percent that&#8217;s how many. I don&#8217;t exactly see the youth of any western country rising up. (Except perhaps the French but they do that all the time.)</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t one mainstream Western politician who gives a fig about about allofmp3.com. Likewise, most politicians don&#8217;t really understand the issues behind copyright. And when the record companies tell them it will lead to industry unemployment they&#8217;ll shaft allofp3, Kazaa, Limewire et. alia.</p>
<p>For crying out loud. Your country has lost over 3000 soldiers in Iraq. Do we see mass protests? No! Do we see Americans demanding subsidised medicine? No. Do we see Americans dumping their gas guzlers and making do with one car instead of three? No! And you think that American youth are rising up against the <span class=""caps"">RIAA</span> whilst at the same time being sued into history? A big fat NO!!!!</p>
<p>My father, an American vet had a saying: &#8220;People get the government they deserve.&#8221; You got George W. Bush: a liar and a cheat.</p>
<p>If you think it&#8217;s any different in Australia forget it. We&#8217;ve got John Howard (and he&#8217;s a rascist <span class=""caps"">AND</span> a liar and a cheat) and his government has just criminalsed copyright breaches. And Tony Blairâ€¦another liar.</p>
<p>Copyright is slowly dying out. It will take another decade or so. And what&#8217;s doing it is the power of technology. Eventually <span class=""caps"">DRM</span> and copyright will become a thing of the past. But the youth rising up. Forget it. In the West if there was an attempt at revolution most people would stay at home and watch it on television. If they thought it interesting they might email some of the footage to their friends.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re having a garage sale sometime between now and November. It promises to lie on the scale ahead of the sandwich stand I decided to run one day (age 9) and just behind the 1939 World&#8217;s Fair, which should explain why we&#8217;re pricing items now.</p>

<p>And while running through boxes collected in the second grade and finding considerable amounts of spare change (not all of it American, oddly), Abbey found my sixth grade yearbook.</p>

<p>Sixth grade. Forever ago. Only six years, yes, but that&#8217;s a third of my life at the moment (gah, how does 18 qualify as &#8216;adult&#8217;?). It&#8217;s hard to even remember what happened there in the halls of what was then James Williams Junior High &#8211; none of this Middle School nonsense. Back in the days when the worst crime imaginable was painting the Hodag&#8217;s eyes red and a five-point demerit was equivocal to a death sentence. No recess for you.</p>

<p>And I&#8217;m flipping through the photos. Seeing occasional signatures, good wishes from friends and the sub that happened to be at school that day.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s weird. For all that junior high brings out the worst in kids (ish), everyone seemed so&#8230; <em>innocent</em>. And now&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say that they&#8217;re/we&#8217;re not, but that&#8217;s kind of how it is. Six years later.</p>

<p>Ha. This girl&#8217;s smiling. &#8230; She never does that anymore.</p>

<p>Ah, hello. Your hair has improved, but you&#8217;re one of the ones that looks precisely the same as you did then. Not a bad thing.</p>

<p>Hrm. Were you gay then too?</p>

<p>Drugs.</p>

<p>Transferred? I don&#8217;t remember you.</p>

<p>Ach. Your house burned down two years later.</p>

<p>Yeah, you run <em>your</em> own site now. Like Something Awful combined with b3ta as performed by a solo high school kid. Well, no. Not &#8216;kid&#8217; anymore.</p>

<p>Oi&#8230; yes. I loved you once. Or thought I did. Hooray for hormonal rushes.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t remember. Did you tell me about the teacher caught with porn? Gah. Even then&#8230;</p>

<p>Band geek meets thespian. You&#8217;re a great actor. But you don&#8217;t smile now any more than you did then.</p>

<p>[ smiles ] You still make me happy.</p>

<p>Ohhh dear. You were my best friend for&#8230; a long time. You died this year. Just down the highway from my house. I&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry? (What do you <em>say</em>?) I wish I had stayed by you.</p>

<p>Ha&#8230; Charismatic as ever. Your signature was loopy and practiced &#8211; I think it still is. Though your haircut has followed fashion.</p>

<p>Twins? I used to tell you apart by your shoes &#8211; figured it out by that time, though.</p>

<p>:D I wish I had met you then.</p>

<p>The girl that no one liked. May the world be better to you than it was then. I still like you.</p>

<p>Aaannnnd you. I was in a play with you. You had a crush on me then. Oddly, though I suppose no one seemed to care how I flipped between wannabe white-boy punk and Ivy-League-for-preteens at the time. [ grins ] And you&#8217;ve changed. The travel was good for you, I think. The substance abuse, less so.</p>

<p>Back to sixth grade. People change in six years. Or, well, maybe they haven&#8217;t. Maybe they&#8217;re just more experienced. The trouble-makers end up in minor court. The student council members earn the scholarships and head east. The ones who looked questionable have probably ended up that way, victims of social profiling. This is America.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t miss sixth grade. Ha, that&#8217;s a ridiculous notion. But I guess I miss the past. Probably everyone does. You don&#8217;t want to go back, but you miss parts of it. The people you knew. The people that people were &#8211; not the people that they&#8217;ve turned out to be. Did they have a choice?</p>

<p>&#8230;</p>

<p>Did you?</p>

Now, to be fair, it&#8217;s my fault. I gave them my address. Indeed, I started the application of my own accord.</p>

<p>But they&#8217;ve hunted me.</p>

<p><strong>March 15</strong> <em>I just want to remind you that the deadline to submit your application to Northern Arizona University is right around the corner &#8230;</em></p>

<p><strong>March 24</strong> <em>According to my records, I haven&#8217;t received your Personal Advantage Application to Northern Arizona University yet.</em> This &#8220;Personal Advantage Application&#8221;, by the way, seems to be a thing of special pride to the Admissions office. Every single message extols its virtues, including such things as no application fee, or no essay. And also a one-week scholarship decision.</p>

<p><strong>March 30</strong> <em>The deadline to submit your Personal Advantage Application is this Sunday, April 1. I hope you use this weekend to complete and submit your application&#8230;</em></p>

<p><strong>April 1</strong> <em>Today&#8217;s your deadline to submit your Personal Advantage Application. Apply before midnight tonight and take advantage of these exclusive benefits&#8230;</em></p>

<p><strong>April 2</strong> You might think that they&#8217;d leave me alone, having missed the deadline. No. <em>I didn&#8217;t see your Personal Advantage Application to Northern Arizona University among those that were submitted last night before the deadline &#8230; but since yesterday was a Sunday, I&#8217;m going to give you <strong>another day</strong> to submit your application.</em> &#8230; What? What kind of excuse is that?!</p>

<p><strong>April 7</strong> So, I didn&#8217;t apply, even given the gratuitous one day extension. But look what arrives in the mailbox: <em>Because you&#8217;re one of the candidates I selected to apply using the Personal Advantage Application, I&#8217;m extending your deadline to apply to Northern Arizona University. Your new deadline is April 15. <span class=""caps"">APPLY</span> <span class=""caps"">NOW</span>!</em></p>

<p><strong>April 12</strong> <em>I&#8217;m writing to you because I really want you to apply to Northern Arizona University &#8230; but the deadline for you to apply with your Personal Advantage Application is this Sunday, April 15.</em></p>

<p><strong>April 15</strong> By this point, I&#8217;m annoyed. But, okay, it&#8217;s the 15th. One last reminder. <em>Isaac, be sure to apply before midnight with your Personal Advantage Application today to make sure you get priority class registration at Northern Arizona University.</em> Fair enough.</p>

<p><strong>April 16</strong> Today, I receive the following email (comments in italics):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Isaac,</p>
<p>Last night was a busy one at Enrollment Services! <em>Oh?</em> We received a lot of Personal Advantage Applications before the midnight deadline. <em>Shame I missed that. Silly me.</em></p>
<p>I was disappointed not to see your application among them, Isaac. You were selected to receive this exclusive, streamlined application because I believe you would achieve success here at Northern Arizona University &#8230; <em>Is this a guilt trip?</em></p>
<p>&#8230; and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m giving you one more day to submit your Personal Advantage Application and still receive all of its benefits.  <em>OH <span class=""caps"">DEAR</span> <span class=""caps"">LORD</span></em></p>

2007-04-23 19:54:02,IIT,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/405.jpg"" /></p>	<p><strong>friday, april 20</strong><br />
So. The decision has been made. I sent a letter of declination to Madison yesterday; left a message at Northwestern. Still have to tell the National Merit guys.</p>

<p>But yeah &#8211; the housing deposit went in with the acceptance form a few days ago. <span class=""caps"">IIT</span> it is.</p>

<p>And I think I&#8217;m excited, actually. Despite the tone I&#8217;m writing in just now (caffeine + antidepressants, you know). <span class=""caps"">IIT</span> really seems like&#8230; the perfect school. Central location in a major US city, great architecture <em>on</em> campus (let alone around Chicago), easy access to public transportation. A undergrad degree in Internet Communication, at less the cost of going to Madison (net of scholarships). Awesome dorms, great food service. Not too far from home.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s kind of hard to believe that&#8230; well, yeah. I had virtually nothing to do with this. Yes, I applied. But that was a fluke &#8211; the application was short and free. <em>What the heck&#8230; If Madison burns down, I&#8217;ll have somewhere to go.</em> The acceptance package came in a few weeks; didn&#8217;t pay much attention. But then the <em>aid</em> offer showed up, and that really couldn&#8217;t be ignored.</p>

<p>So we started looking more closely at this <span class=""caps"">IIT</span> place. People who know of it only have good things to say, and it&#8217;s been around (as Armour Tech) since the late 1800s. Great programs, great people. It didn&#8217;t show up in any of my school searches, no one mentioned it to me. Like I said &#8211; an apparent fluke that&#8217;s turned out really, really well. Thanks, God.</p>

<p>So &#8211; it&#8217;s done. Set. Decided. I&#8217;ll be in Chicago this time next year.</p>

Oi. [ yawns ] I fell asleep in front of the computer in my room at around 5:30 yesterday. (Not as weird as it sounds if you know how my room is laid out.) Woke up once for a half hour, went back to sleep. Until midnight. I was confused, upon waking up &#8211; it was dark, and no one was up. So I went back to bed. That&#8217;s like&#8230; twelve hours of sleep. Wonderful.</p>

<p><strong>1:19 am, work</strong><br />
I love my sr. boss. All the more because he refers to it as American Telephone & Telegraph. Not AT&T.</p>

<p><strong>3:27 pm, work</strong><br />
Back from school. It&#8217;s interesting &#8211; to be &#8220;back&#8221;, for me, means &#8220;at work&#8221;.</p>

<p>Anyway. Some sort of calamity at school &#8211; a threat, by the sounds of it. The staff can&#8217;t say anything, obviously. (This bothers me.) No backpacks allowed, no large purses. Only enter/exit through the front door. I&#8217;m guessing bomb threat, but&#8230; bah. If there was any serious danger, I <del>assume</del> hope we&#8217;d be sent home.</p>

<p>Played calc football during fourth hour. &#8220;Right, run x=10 until the intersection with the integral of sin(x), then head back in the direction of the fourth quadrant&#8221;. Good stuff. We&#8217;re challenging the stats class to a game of kickball. &#8220;Those students who think that they&#8217;re taking a <em>math</em> class&#8230; Ha! Integrate <em>this</em>!&#8221;</p>

2007-04-26 20:41:27,why?,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/407.jpg"" /></p>	<p><em>The best defense against the atom bomb is not to be there when it goes off.</em> British Army Journal</p>

<p>The principal told the school yesterday at 2:50pm that an &#8220;inappropriate message&#8221; had been found, and that the administration was working with the sheriff&#8217;s department to sort it out. Additionally, no backpacks or large bags would be allowed. You may enter and exit only through the front doors.</p>

<p>The obvious conclusion to make was that there was a bomb threat. Forget this &#8220;inappropriate message&#8221; stuff; if they&#8217;re not allowing large bags, it&#8217;s a bomb. You can fit a gun in your pocket.</p>

<p>In a similar fashion, the principal made an announcement today at 11:10am, saying what everyone had guessed &#8211; there is, in fact, a bomb threat. What wasn&#8217;t expected was the date &#8211; May 7. Now tell me, May <em>7</em>? That&#8217;s more than two weeks from now.</p>

<p>For what purpose would a hypothetical bomber make a threat and leave the powers that be with more than two weeks to mull it over? ... A demand? Something that admin would <em>need</em> two weeks to decide to comply with? And what could you demand from a high school anyway? If such a bomber just wanted to do the school in, he&#8217;d have done so already &#8211; no warning needed.</p>

<p>Unless he wanted to inspire fear. (Which he&#8217;s probably achieved, to some extent; kudos to admin for keeping their heads about them.) But <em>why</em>? Why why why why why?</p>

<p>This was in the <a href=""http://rhinelanderdailynews.com/articles/2007/04/26/news/news04.txt"">Daily News</a>:</p>

<p>According to Dr. Roger Erdahl, superintendent of the Rhinelander School District, the inappropriate message, which he referred to as a â€œthreatâ€ was made in writing and delivered Wednesday.</p>

<p>Made in writing and delivered. Does this not sound like a threat with a <em>point</em>? Not just a prank?</p>

<p>Interestingly, the <a href=""http://rhinelanderdailynews.com/articles/2007/04/18/records/public_records/rec04.txt"">public records</a> indicate that someone will be going to court for a past bomb scare. I&#8217;m fairly sure that this is the guy responsible for a threat&#8230; last year(?) at the high school. He&#8217;s still a student, at any rate. Interesting that he&#8217;s going to court now, at the same time that a new threat is present.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv
2007-04-28 17:37:45,Reanimation (album review),"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/408.jpg"" /></p>	<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard this yet (and even if you have, I suppose), <a href=""http://linkinpark.com"">Linkin Park</a> is releasing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minutes_to_Midnight_(album)"">Minutes to Midnight</a> on May 14.</p>

<p>Because of this, it&#8217;s probably still okay for me to toss out a review of what is still their latest album &#8211; Reanimation. I bought the thing at Walmart the other day on a whim. 7usd-something, down from 14.</p>

<p><strong>1: Opening</strong> (Mike Shinoda)<br />
The album opens with an excerpt from <span class=""caps"">KRWLNG</span>. Moody, introspective. Drawn-out strings topping an audioscape-style progression. Sets the mood for the album.</p>

<p><strong>2: Pts. Of. Athrty</strong> (Jay Gordon)<br />
The mix for this track is considerably more edgy than the original. As mixes go, it&#8217;s not terribly original &#8211; the original elements remain more or less intact and the song&#8217;s progression is untouched. It&#8217;s not bad in that it expands on the original&#8217;s mood without sacrificing any impact, but as a mix, it&#8217;s not that great. C+.</p>

<p><strong>3: Ente E ND</strong> (KutMasta Kurt)<br />
The mix artist should not be using the song as a plug. D.</p>

<p><strong>4: Chali</strong><br />
Linkin Park tosses in a few skits with this album. Not full-blown skits, just thirty-second clips from an answering machine. ... Why?</p>

<p><strong>5: FRGT/10</strong> (Chali 2na)<br />
Not a lot to say here. It annoys me when multiple (and drastically different) vocalists are in one song, especially when a secondary vocalists makes up new lyrics. Now, granted, it&#8217;s a remix. But still. Influence from uninspired rappers armed with synths and drum machines doesn&#8217;t do a lot of good. B.</p>

<p><strong>6: P5hng Me A*wy</strong> (Mike Shinoda)<br />
Directly contrary to what I just finished saying, Mike does a decent job mixing in his own vocals next to Chester&#8217;s. A <em>nice</em> job. They complement nicely (harmony bit on the chorus is great), and he doesn&#8217;t try to take over with extraneous verses. The guy takes the term &#8220;mix&#8221; and does it credit &#8211; he twists and flips the original around into something completely other, but still reminiscent of Hybrid Theory. <em>Well</em> done. A-.</p>

<p><strong>7: <span class=""caps"">PLC</span>. 4 Mie HÃ¦d</strong> (Amp Live)<br />
Meh. It&#8217;s okay. B.</p>

<p><strong>8: X-Ecutioner Style</strong> (Black Thought)<br />
Overly angsty? Not nearly melodic as it could be. All credit to Black Thought for mixing multiple songs together into something new, but I&#8217;m not too fond of this one. C.</p>

<p><strong>9: H! Vltg3</strong> (DJ Babu)<br />
Right there next to track seven as far as the music is concerned (kudos for using a piano, but a loop?), though the lyrics are cool. My blood type&#8217;s Krylon Technicolor Type A. B-.</p>

<p><strong>10: Riff Raff</strong><br />
Another skit. It fits in with the album, but I don&#8217;t know that these were necessary.</p>

<p><strong>11: <span class=""caps"">WTH</span>>You</strong> (Aceyalone)<br />
Feels a lot like something Linkin Park themselves would do with the song. Which makes sense &#8211; though Aceyalone is credited on the album cover, Mike Shinoda and Joe Hahn (both of Linkin Park) worked on this as well. B.</p>

<p><strong>12: NTRMssion</strong> (Mike Shinoda)<br />
A lot like the opening.</p>

<p><strong>13: PPR: Kut</strong> (Cheapshot & Jubacca)<br />
&#8220;Kut&#8221;. It works with the whole let&#8217;s-rework-every-song-title, but c->k is overused. Generally speaking, and speaking generally for the actual mix itself. C.</p>

<p><strong>14: Rnw@Y</strong> (Backyard Bangers)<br />
Removing half of the lyrics and re-doing the other half is creative, but won&#8217;t carry a song. It&#8217;s catchy, but&#8230; yeah, could be better. B-.</p>

<p><strong>15: My&lt;DSMBR</strong> (Kelli Alli)<br />
I <span class=""caps"">FREAKING</span> <span class=""caps"">LOVE</span> <span class=""caps"">THIS</span> <span class=""caps"">SONG</span>. Beautiful. Better than the original. (And mixed by a female.) A.</p>

<p><strong>16: Stef</strong><br />
Skit&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>17: By_myself</strong> (Josh Abraham)<br />
Also well done. Enough new elements were (tastefully) added to make it new, and enough of the old is present in new form to make it work well. A-.</p>

<p><strong>18: Kyur4 TH Ich</strong> (Chairman Hahn)<br />
I didn&#8217;t much like the original, either. Not that this is much <em>like</em> the original (definitely an instrumental line from Points of Authority in there), but&#8230; yeah. Respectable, but not something to cheer wildly over. C+.</p>

<p><strong>19: 1stp Klosr</strong> (Humble Brothers)<br />
Got a bit of mild <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabber"">gabber</a> going on with this selection. Nice. A-.</p>

<p><strong>20: KRWLNG</strong> (Aaron Lewis)<br />
Appropriately, the album concludes with the full version of <span class=""caps"">KRWLNG</span>, a taste of which was given in the opening. This really is a beautiful song &#8211; the kind you can sit back with your eyes closed and get lost in. ... I&#8217;m unsure what else I can really say about this, except that it probably makes the album. (Along with My<<span class=""caps"">DSMBR</span>. :)) A.</p>

<p>Conclusion: would I buy this again? Probably. Or, well, perhaps not. Maybe I&#8217;d just buy a few tracks. Idk. Linkin Park deserves a lot of credit for pulling in musicians and pulling off an entire remix album. Not all of the songs are a perfect work of art, like most albums, but there are a few in here that stand out all the more. Cool.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, it has come to my attention that there have been accusations, and you&#8217;re going to find this hard to believe, but there <em>have</em> been accusations of an anti-American bias here at the <span class=""caps"">BBC</span>. I&#8217;ve searched my soul, and upon finding it almost entirely morally bankrupt and devoid of any sensible answers, I did a Google search instead.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are thousands of websites devoted to this exact subject. There&#8217;s one called &#8220;American Thinker&#8221;. Now&#8230; Come on, that&#8217;s not fair &#8211; it&#8217;s hardly my fault if you say &#8220;American&#8221; and you feel you <em>have</em> to point out you&#8217;re capable of thinking, but <em>that</em> is the name of the website. Anyway &#8211; their London correspondent Michael Morris said &#8220;America is being slandered minute by minute, hour by hour, every day of the year by the <span class=""caps"">BBC</span>. The <span class=""caps"">BBC</span> is the enemy of all right-thinking people who understand that the world is a safer place with the Trans-Atlantic Alliance intact.&#8221; He means, of course, the Special Relationship. Now I&#8217;ve said this before, but the Special Relationship basically boils down to the fact that we couldn&#8217;t be bothered to learn French. This is roughly what happened &#8211; one chap tried, but no, we&#8217;re going to be friends with those people over there. We don&#8217;t really like them and they&#8217;re further away, but seriously, what is the subjunctive tense? You see, I think we have a lot in common with the French. People seem to think the French have no sense of humour. Not true &#8211; the French <em>wrote</em> the European Constitution &#8211; and then voted &#8216;no&#8217; on it. Now, <em>that&#8217;s</em> funny on about four different levels. It&#8217;s incredible.</p>
<p>So, if the <span class=""caps"">BBC</span> <em>is</em> anti-American, why would that be? Well, because America&#8217;s broken the world. Look, I can&#8217;t speak for the entire <span class=""caps"">BBC</span> &#8211; I&#8217;d like to, obviously, but because the <span class=""caps"">BBC</span> is a Communist organization, they don&#8217;t have kings, which is a shame really, I have to make do with six minutes on Radio 4 once a week. Anyway, I&#8217;m taking responsibility in looking at my own attitudes toward the United States.</p>
<p>I think the first thing to say is that I&#8217;m not&#8230; <em>angry</em> with America, I&#8217;m just&#8230; disappointed. And scared. And angry. America is a brilliant idea, it really is &#8211; it&#8217;s up there with marmite, the zit, and the internet. It&#8217;s fantastic &#8211; it&#8217;s just broken. If America was marmite it&#8217;d be full of margarine and toast crumbs. And for some reason, Guinness (it tastes the same; stop paying more for it!). If America was a zit, it would have the top third of somewhere very undignified trapped in it, so that no matter which way you pull, the agony and degradation can only get worse. If America were the internet, it would be <a href=""http://www.bt.com/"">BT (bloody) broadband</a>.</p>
<p>Iraq is a good example of why I feel negatively about the US right now. Saddam Hussein was a bad man, connected with some incredibly dangerous people &#8211; Cheney, Rumsfeld, George Galloway. But seriously, right, here is a question for America and the UK to answer &#8211; how do you make Iraq worse than it was before? It was a mess before we were rushed in there by the hawks and neocon murderers in the White House. Conditions there were beyond awful. You can&#8217;t <em>make</em> something like that worse; it&#8217;s already <em>at</em> maximum crapness. That&#8217;s like getting a glass of Sunny Delight and putting Bailey&#8217;s in it. It&#8217;s like buying a Burberry cap and attaching a radio to the side &#8211; it&#8217;s already as bad as it can get! It&#8217;s like a Lloyd Webber musical and then asking Ben Elton to do the lyrics.</p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;m critical of America because they&#8217;re in charge. We consume American films, television, music, literature, journalism, foreign policy, weapons contracts, food. Some of our children go out not wearing one, but <em>two</em> baseball caps at the same time. (You look like a tosser, and don&#8217;t stay &#8220;gangstah&#8221;, you live next to Nottingham.) In truth, I&#8217;m glad that America is the world&#8217;s only superpower. I&#8217;d choose it over China, Russia or Scotland any day of the week. (I include Scotland on that list because if the <span class=""caps"">SNP</span> have their way, who knows how powerful Alex Salmond may become? I think he may be a Jedi.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no good complaining we&#8217;re critical of the US &#8211; of <em>course</em> we are. They&#8217;re the ones running the show &#8211; that&#8217;s our <em>job</em>. They are the boss of the world, and if the hand that feeds is only giving you cheeseburgers and Starbucks then it needs to be bitten. We got our sailors back from the dreadful Ahmadinejad (&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s a <em>bad</em> man; he is so naughty and immoral&#8230;&#8221;). Well, the US is still holding a large number of Iranians without proper charges or representation, and Guantanamo Bay is still full of people who have been there for five years.</p>
<p>So for all I mock and criticize the United States, I do it in the hope that it really <em>could</em> be the land of the free and the home of the brave. It&#8217;s a land of pioneering immigrants from <em>everywhere</em> &#8211; including space, if you believe people in the Midwest. It has <em>boundless</em> possibilities and opportunities for good. Whilst they may be responsible for git-wizards like Bain or the Microsoft paperclip (bendy-metal -------...), let&#8217;s not forget they gave us The West Wing, Ben &#38; Jerry&#8217;s Ice Cream, and Elvis.</p>
<p>So while we in the UK are so far up America&#8217;s back passage that we can see the next doughnut as it&#8217;s forced down its swollen, gluttonous throat, let&#8217;s <em>be</em> critical. Let&#8217;s <em>raise</em> questions, and let&#8217;s <em>watch</em> Curb Your Enthusiasm because <em>that</em> is what the license fee is for. Thank you.</p>

2007-04-30 06:10:50,Why we believe,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/409.jpg"" /></p>	<p>If you look at life long enough, one thing more or less becomes completely clear: something is not right. And in fact, something is quite wrong. (For those of you who caught that allusion, more power to you. And yes, there are support groups.)</p>

<p>Just <em>look</em> at it. People are born, live, and die. There are two ways to view this: each person is a miracle of life, or, look &#8211; they keep reproducing. The temptation to become completely cynical is, well, tempting. And if all you&#8217;re looking at is the planet Earth, then yes, cynicism is what any thinking person is probably going to end up with.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the subject of this particular entry. Why we believe. I&#8217;m going to bring up The Matrix again (&#8220;again&#8221;, yes, if you&#8217;ve been here a while) &#8211; remember the scene where the Architect is disseminating Neo as a human? &#8220;Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion.&#8221;</p>

<p>People hope. Why on <em>earth</em>?</p>

<p>Or okay, let&#8217;s start here. Hope. The desire to see something better in the future. This is weird, right, considering the finality and inevitability of death. People live and die, largely without making a scratch on the surface. Those who aspire to <em>change the world</em> might have some effect, but in the scheme of human history and all foreseeable future, it&#8217;s negligible. You&#8217;re quite literally one in a million.</p>

<p>So why hope? Why want to expect something better for <em>you</em>, insignificant and ultimately worthless you?</p>

<p>Because you don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re worthless. Or don&#8217;t want to believe it, I suppose.</p>

<p>And this is why we believe. Believe in God, believe in the power of good, believe in something <em>better</em>, what have you. Because if life is all we have, we don&#8217;t matter. And we know it. On some level, we know it. <em>Looking</em> at life as it is, it&#8217;s largely futile. Get an education, a good job, provide for the kids. And then they do it over again. To what end? If there&#8217;s nothing to believe in, then nothing. That&#8217;s it &#8211; for all practical purposes, you&#8217;re a Walmart paperclip. Do something passive for while, then when your job is done, you&#8217;re gone. And there are always more like you.</p>

<p>A friend of mine made the comment that illusions are kind of necessary for sanity. I think he&#8217;s right, to the extent that if we don&#8217;t believe anything beyond the immediately concrete, our ability to function is out. And this point is of particular importance &#8211; if we can&#8217;t function without believing something intangible, what does that say? Is it an inherent flaw, or is it by&#8230; well, design?</p>

<p>And <em>this</em> gets into the debate about the existence of God. On this, I&#8217;m only going to say that it&#8217;s largely impossible to prove. Christianity and atheism are both nuts. Christians can&#8217;t prove God exists; atheists can&#8217;t prove He doesn&#8217;t. The finite cannot grapple with the theoretically infinite.</p>

<p>But I suppose that&#8217;s what it comes down to, isn&#8217;t it? The theoretically infinite. It&#8217;s an intangible, and is therefore entirely necessary. If there wasn&#8217;t something more, if this is all we&#8217;ve got, then screw life.</p>

<p>This is why we believe.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv
2007-05-01 19:57:42,stuff from today,"<p>It&#8217;s quarter after nine, and I&#8217;m in Psychology. Everyone&#8217;s expressing their reactions to the memory project grade &#8211; either disappointment or confusion. And aggravation. :) Ah well. Fourth-term senior.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m breaking out fairly badly &#8211; hives covering my forearms. Odd. A friend-of-family recommended an allergy clinic in Lacrosse. Might have to check that one out. This has been happening for roughly a year with no obvious cause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncovering your personal defense mechanisms&#8221;. Right, I understand that it&#8217;s a good thing to delve into your own psyche, but writing down what you find and turning it in for a grade strikes me as something of an institutional invasion of privacy. Not that high school isn&#8217;t, but&#8230; yeah. Let&#8217;s leave that blank.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>Post-spanish, at work. I looked out the window into the school courtyard. There was this girl sitting alone at one of the tables with her lunchbag. No one else was there, just her. And the robins. She waved at them. She&#8217;s one of the disabled students; I&#8217;m unsure what her particular disability is. Probably one of the saddest things I&#8217;ve seen as of late.</p>

<p>Thought: the strongest indicator of this generation&#8217;s screwed-up-ness is the music. When the &#8220;Today&#8217;s Hits&#8221; station on <a href=""http://slacker.com"">Slacker</a> will only play Timberlake, Chris Brown, Akon, Diddy, Daddy Yankee and Mary J. Bilge, there&#8217;s a problem. Melodic rap on uninspired love themes is not music, even if you&#8217;re black.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>I took the Jung test over at <a href=""http://similarminds.com/jung.html"">similarminds.com</a> for psych.</p>

<p>I took the test no less than three times, deciding at the last to answer based on who I happen to be, rather than who I try to be. :/</p>

<p>But interestingly, the test script sent me off to <a href=""http://introspectives.org"">introspectives.org</a> after giving the test results. I&#8217;m intrigued.</p>

<p>Six a.m. arrived waay earlier than it should have, or would have, had I any say in the matter. Self-help books will have no credence in my mind until they can properly teach the manipulation of time.</p>

<p>But yeah. Alarm went off, and despite my vow from the night before to get up on time, the sleep button found itself repeatedly shoved around and generally abused. <span class=""caps"">NHS</span> meetings are way too early.</p>

<p>So here I sit, falling asleep, but with a heightened awareness of doing so. I was late for first hour. Felt like the coffee would be worth it. &#8220;Twenty ounce triple iced latte, half a shot rum<sup class=""footnote""><a href=""#fn1439031950463928263a0d9"">1</a></sup>, half a shot java.&#8221; My punch card was full.</p>

<p>Admin is considering banning drinks brought in to the school. This line of thinking is completely understandable and defensible &#8211; enough people bring in laced drinks to make it a problem worth addressing &#8211; but it would really tick off a lot of people. Me, for example. Caffeine = energy and a decent mood, more often than not, and I suspect that it&#8217;s the same for many others.</p>

<p>Though that brings up the issue of energy drinks. My take: the occasional doubleshot or Rockstar probably isn&#8217;t a bad thing, but downing Cocaine during class is ridiculous. <em>Cocaine</em> is ridiculous. Especially if you require medical attention because you passed out after drinking one.</p>

<p>Channel 12 came in and interviewed a couple students on the subject of energy drinks. I brought a Dew to the interview.</p>

<p>Banning foreign drinks would definitely cut down on the abuse of such drinks, but wouldn&#8217;t eliminate it entirely. This isn&#8217;t a pertinent argument, of course; banning tobacco hasn&#8217;t gotten rid of the wear mark in people&#8217;s back pockets. And stripsearching everyone in order to find a hidden Monster would be rediculous &#8211; can&#8217;t micromanage that kind of thing. Enacting the policy would <em>help</em>, yes, but&#8230; bah. Admin will lose a lot of face with the student body if they do this, and they&#8217;d have to win that back. Either by opening a coffee shop in the school or&#8230; idk, something. If you don&#8217;t want kids drinking vodka from a Dasani bottle, okay. That&#8217;s fine, and if you know it&#8217;s happening, it&#8217;s your responsibility to do something. But while Cocaine can seriously screw up your physiology, do they have the right to deny it to you? It&#8217;s your right, after all &#8211; they can suggest a healthy diet and serve balanced meals in the cafeteria, but can&#8217;t stop you from picking up McD&#8217;s instead.</p>

<p>But yeah. What do you do. The world would be simpler and probably better off if humanity had just done itself in at some point. But here we are, tenaciously clinging to a slightly unstable existence, and drinking vodka in class.</p>

<p>And coffee.</p>

Eee. Once again, and infallibly, it is morning. Probability would have it that at some point, six ay em would show up and it <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> be morning, but today is not that day.</p>

<p><strong>in spanish, not doing homework. again.</strong><br />
I read something somewhere about a theory in which two solids coming into contact repeatedly ad infinitum would theoretically fall through each other at some point. Can&#8217;t find anything directly related to that anywhere.</p>

<p>Though interestingly, Sra knows a <em>ton</em> about physics. An interesting character, that one. ... Yeah. Interesting that she&#8217;s a spanish teacher and not a physicist.</p>

<p>So. It sounded to her like harmonic resonance, only applied to molecular solids instead of waves (so kinda like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_harmonic_oscillator"">quantum harmoic oscillation</a>, without actually knowing anything about it). And after trolling wikipedia for a while, that&#8217;s about what I came up with. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_coherence"">Atomic coherence</a> is more or less as close as I got &#8211; when the electron spin of multiple atoms are aligned, they can pass through each other (the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabi_cycle"">Rabi cycle</a>, from what I can tell).</p>

<p>Everything that I could find on the subject outside of Wikipedia (excepting <a href=""http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/phy05/phy05027.htm"">q/a</a>) seemed rather <a href=""http://www.rense.com/general66/solid.htm"">the-aliens-are-coming-esque</a>.</p>

<p>So&#8230; yeah&#8230; we&#8217;re going over self-actualization and the like in psychology. Why we aspire to greatness, and why we don&#8217;t. What&#8217;s needed for ambition, and the conflict between self-perception and potential. I printed out <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/2007/04/30/why-we-believe"">why we believe</a>, partly because it could plausibly be applied as extra credit (no motivation during first hour = less than desirable grade), partly to see what reaction Nelson would have to it. He also is an interesting guy (though I suppose hs teachers are generally like that). I decided for a while that I didn&#8217;t much like him (during the days of econ&#8230; just goes to show how carefully motivation needs to be examined), but I&#8217;m reevaluating that. I can see more of him in this class than in econ. <em>See</em>, based on more than only how he tries to act. Which methinks is what econ was &#8211; an act. A respectable act &#8211; it&#8217;s probably difficult to get adolescents to care about the economy &#8211; but an act nonetheless. Hrm.</p>

2007-05-07 05:42:20,God as RenderMan,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/422.jpg"" /></p>	<p>I was at Hodag Park the other night, sitting by the lake. Watching the water. For the record: it&#8217;s still cold. Numb feet.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting, watching the waves intersect with each other in a perfectly orderly fashion. Like trig and physics, being played out on the lake. It crossed my mind that all of this happens naturally &#8211; all the laws of nature carried out without any perceptible maintence, while programmers and designers work for years perfecting rendering engines and ai&#8217;s to replicate what happens every day. Amazing that we work so hard to imitate the ordinary, and that it takes so much to model it.</p>

<p>Which brings me to a theory: reality exists in the mind of God. I don&#8217;t give a whole lot of weight to this, but it&#8217;s worth thinking through.</p>

<p>So. Reality happens &#8211; laws of physics and whatnot. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, etc. We write simulations, right, that replicate this kind of thing. Virtual reality, if you will, where laws are followed, but movements have to be calculated and put into play. The better the processor, the closer to realtime such a simulation can get. But the simulation doesn&#8217;t happen on its own &#8211; every action and reaction is calculated.</p>

<p>Now, there&#8217;s no obvious evidence that what we live in is anything like this. From our point of view, you throw a rock and it goes off and hits the ground without anyone having to think through the motions and ensure that the physics are carried out. But does that make sense? If we were a part of a virtual reality simulation, would it appear the same way? Things wouldn&#8217;t seem to be calculated and put into action, they&#8217;d seem to happen &#8220;naturally&#8221;.</p>

<p>So this kind of plays off of the theory that for every n-dimensional being, there&#8217;s always an n+1 being out there. We create virtual reality where there are rules, but everything must be calculated and maintained as the rules are followed. Mightn&#8217;t it be the same for our reality? What if God is the renderer, if you will, that powers our world?</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>Are these accurate? Yeah, I think so. Nothing on here surprises me &#8211; inquisitive people with introverted tendencies probably know themselves decently. All the same, it&#8217;s reassuring to see something (theoretically) solid about yourself. Things more definite when you can read it in print. This is why tabloids sell.</p>

<p><strong>addendum</strong><br />
&#8220;often aware how the color and lighting of a room affects their mood&#8221;. :D That&#8217;s excellent.</p>

<p>It is interesting, now that I think about it, that I scored two different <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits"">big five</a> types &#8211; <span class=""caps"">RCUAI</span> and <span class=""caps"">RLUAI</span>. Both are fairly accurate, though <span class=""caps"">RCUAI</span> seems to be me when I&#8217;m particularly low/demotivated.</p>

<p>The characters in each name are of binary value &#8211; each place can one of two values:</p>

<p>Social / <strong>Reserved</strong><br />
Limbic / Calm<br />
Organized / <strong>Unstructured</strong><br />
<strong>Accommodating</strong> / Egocentric<br />
Non-curious / <strong>Inquisitive</strong></p>

<p>More interesting is the fact that my MBTI/Jung type (<span class=""caps"">INTP</span>) correponds to <span class=""caps"">RCUEI</span> and/or <span class=""caps"">RLUEI</span> &#8211; close to what I scored, but indicative of an egocentric personality instead of tendencies toward accommodation. I&#8217;m going to go with &#8216;accommodating&#8217; over &#8216;egocentric&#8217;, though one would <a href=""http://similarminds.com/global5/g5-jung.html"">expect</a> <a href=""http://similarminds.com/jung/infp.html"">INFP</a> instead of <span class=""caps"">INTP</span>, if that was the case. Ah well. Both are fairly close to what I am.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv
2007-05-09 08:00:00,minutes to midnight / shadow of the day,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/425.jpg"" /></p>	<p>Linkin Park is releasing Minutes to Midnight worldwide on the 14th, with the North American release coming the day after. I found that odd, initially, as it would have been on both limewire and Allofmp3 as soon as the first CD in Russia was sold.</p>

<p>That particular point, however, is moot. The album was <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minutes_to_Midnight_(album)#Leak"">leaked</a> on the 6th, treating the world to the newest manifestation of Linkin Park a full nine days early. As a musician, this kinda made me mad. Shinoda, though, had this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the same time, a leak leaves out some very important parts of this piece of work. We put months of creative energy into the <span class=""caps"">ART</span> of the record, in the booklet, special edition, and big book&#8230; almost as long as it took to record Hybrid Theory&#8230;</p>
<p>At the very least, if you&#8217;ve already downloaded the songs, do us a huge favor and listen to them in the right order &#8230; it&#8217;ll be way more rewarding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good guys. But while musicians might be irked, the LP fan base is delighted. The general consensus on the <a href=""http://www.linkinpark.com/lpmb"">LP forums</a> is to download the music now, and buy the album upon release. It&#8217;s illegal, yeah. Respectable? Yeah, probably. It&#8217;s indicative of the satisfy-me-now culture, but&#8230; c&#8217;mon, it&#8217;s LP&#8217;s first album in <em>years!</em></p>

<p>That said, I torrented the thing (thanks, Anthony&#8230;). And it&#8217;s excellent. Completely (well, not completely) different than they&#8217;ve done previously. Nu metal is gone, as was made evident when What I&#8217;ve Done was released as a single. And&#8230; yeah. This album is <del>excellent</del> <del>awesome</del> superb. And that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m going to say. Ignore the people who mock LP for &#8220;selling out&#8221; (someone actually <a href=""http://forums.linkinpark.com/showthread.php?p=13950#post13950"">said that</a>... sigh).</p>

<p>Anyway. I&#8217;m going to post this song now, breaking probably one more regulation about song use as it&#8217;s not yet been released. Ah well. Consider it a teaser. Buy the album. Or preorder it on iTunes &#8211; the two bonus songs from that edition aren&#8217;t online, as far as I&#8217;m aware.</p>

<p>Anyway. I&#8217;m listening to a twenty-something-minute track designed to simulate schizophrenia. Hannah did this yesterday, from what she tells me. Really worked effectively there, but I daresay that listening to Aphex Twin and work in sound design has desensitized me. I kinda want a copy of this, just to toy with.</p>

<p>Though the activity has reminded me of&#8230; shoot, when was that&#8230; idk, a long time ago. I literally did have voices in my head &#8211; voices screaming so loud, I couldn&#8217;t hear anything else.

<p>I wrote my psych paper on personality last night. A decidedly uninspired work of prose, explaining that an understanding of personality is useful when manipulating co-workers.</p>

<p><em>A slow strangle with your feet on the floor</em><br />

<p>Life has been interesting. Largely, I suppose. I&#8217;m trying to work on Workplace Confessional when I think of it, and when I&#8217;m not scrambling to make up calc wrkshts or personality tests for psych.

<p>I&#8217;m walking out of the high school front doors. Security is ridiculous. Not because it&#8217;s overkill, but because it&#8217;s impossible to enforce.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s misting outside, enough to cover your windshield, but not enough to use the wipers. Fifty four, overcast. A crow chokes on the air and flaps over the school&#8217;s sign, passing me walking on Acacia Lane. The blacktop is mottled damp, little pools where the road crew missed.</p>

<p><em>and the shadow of the day</em><br />
<em>will embrace the world in grey</em></p>

<p>I would give anything &#8211; anything &#8211; to be able to save a moment. Capture the sound flying around your head, the scent of the air whispering past and the fabric of something concrete under your feet. To take in over and over again the visual, aural, tactile atmosphere of a moment.</p>

<p>The tragedy, to me, is time. We&#8217;re only given a second to take everything in before having it torn away, shreds replaced with something new.</p>

<p>If time could just <em>stop</em> &#8211; give us a <em>chance</em> to explore <em>now</em>, to take in the world without being forced forward. Give us an eternity without time, where infinity can be sought out from every angle.</p>

<em>something I</em><br />

<p>With that statement, my world has reached equilibrium. Ying yang, and already at quarter to eight. Heh.</p>

<p>The AP Language (English) was yesterday. If you&#8217;ve never taken a 3.5hr test alone in a room with the proctor sitting in the corner, avoid it like the plague. Unless you have good reason not to, in which case, have at it. (And call me if you need to talk.) The test itself wasn&#8217;t that bad, when one considers that <span class=""caps"">RHS</span> doesn&#8217;t actually prepare a student for such material. Very&#8230; hrm. Read-the-passage and clarify-the-shades-of-meaning-esque. Not too bad. And I got to equate religion and advertising in the first essay. :D</p>

<p>A quote from one of the passages:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>1:01pm</strong></p>

<p>Someone from the area mental health facilities came in, along with two mentally ill/diseased individuals. And the internet is slow here.</p>

<p>Anyway, yeah. Some interesting things were said. One of the guys has a diagnosis for bipolar, the other has some variant of schizophrenia. Both relatively symptom-free al momento, largely thanks to medication.</p>

<p>One thing that I&#8217;ve noticed about mental health professionals is their tendency to clarify. Marijuana is an <em>inappropriate</em> drug, your mental condition is <em>abnormal</em>, not wrong. There&#8217;s an almost obligatory focus on hope, the colloquial light at the end of the tunnel &#8211; they steer conversation around to a positive conclusion. This is their job, of course, but in a panel discussion where the point is to see mental health through the eyes of the blind, so to speak, ... idk, didn&#8217;t know if that was appropriate. Not that the conversation didn&#8217;t need helping along, but&#8230; ah. What have you.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m absolutely exhausted. Picked up a Dew from the teachers&#8217; lounge lounge before homeroom (slap); little bit better. Was kind of a late night, getting someone&#8217;s school project onto a <span class=""caps"">VCD</span>... bah.</p>

If they&#8217;re selling straight mp3/4s for a comparable price and they can <em>pitch</em> the thing with any skill, beating the competition will be effortless. But that&#8217;s not the <em>point</em>, people. The point is that music can now, legally, be free.</p>

<p>This, first of all, means that there are five days left of my high school career.</p>

<p>Secondly, it means that Anthony & Co. is done with school.</p>

<p>Third, my laptop is a day closer to showing up (ship date predicted to be Thursday, theoretically putting it on the doorstep the following Tuesday), and I think my web hosting bill is overdue. Now that I think about it.</p>

<p>But yeah. It&#8217;s Friday. I didn&#8217;t have to work today, so I took third hour and went for a drive. Got pizza and a Dew from Trig&#8217;s first, and politely declined someone&#8217;s lunch offer. I didn&#8217;t intend to go to Wausau. But I did. And feel better for doing so, actually. It&#8217;s an odd concept, leaving randomly and just <em>going</em> for two hours. But&#8230; yeah. A good thing.</p>

2007-05-19 18:45:38,ike_slideshow,"<p><strong>Out of date &#8211; visit the <a href=""http://textpattern.org/plugins/789/ike_slideshow"">textpattern.org listing</a> for the most current release.</strong></p>

<h2>Generalness</h2>

<p>Oddly, there seems to be no straightforward image slideshow plugin. Yes, there&#8217;s an entire <a href=""http://textpattern.org/categoryarchive/?c=galleries"">category</a> of gallery plugins, but nothing really&#8230; simple.</p>

<p>Hence, ike_slideshow. Toss in a pinch of Javascript and a dash of <span class=""caps"">CSS</span>, and away we go. Customize to your heart&#8217;s content.</p>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<p><txp:ike_slideshow ids=""447,442,440,439,415,420,403,376"" /></p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>At the moment, there is only one tag: <code>ike_slideshow</code>. Appropriately, there is only one attribute: <code>ids</code>. Set <code>ids</code> to equal a comma-delineated list of image ids.</p>

<p>Example:<br />
<code>&#60;txp:ike_slideshow ids=&#34;1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10&#34; /&#62;</code></p>

<p>For the slideshow to function properly, you&#8217;ll need to have the following Javascript and <span class=""caps"">CSS</span> in place. I use <a href=""http://textpattern.org/plugins/728/stm_javascript"">stm_javascript</a> to handle the JS, but do as you wish. Customize the <span class=""caps"">CSS</span> to fit your site.</p>

<p>Javascript:</p>

<textarea readonly=""readonly"" class=""code"" cols=""78"" onclick=""this.select();"">var finished = false;
var i = 0;
function ike_slideshow( slideshow_id, jump ) {
slideshow = document.getElementById( slideshow_id );
images = slideshow.getElementsByTagName( ""li"" );
finished=false;
for(i=0;i<images.length;i++){
if(finished) break;
if(images[i].style.display==""block"") {
if((i==0&&jump==-1)||(i+1==images.length&&jump==1)) break;
images[i+jump].style.display=""block"";
images[i].style.display=""none"";
finished=true;
}
}
}</textarea>

<p><span class=""caps"">CSS</span>:</p>

<textarea readonly=""readonly"" class=""code"" cols=""78"" onclick=""this.select();"">.ike-slideshow {
border: 1px #dddddd solid;
padding: 5px;
margin: 10px;
}

padding: 2px 4px;

}</textarea>

<p>Anyway&#8230; yeah.

At a guess. Shrek wasn&#8217;t bad &#8211; superb animation, as always &#8211; but it bothers me that it&#8217;s an adult&#8217;s film in kid&#8217;s-film packaging. This means that a ton of kids go to see it (including a selection of the handicapped, from what we saw), and get exposed to&#8230; what&#8217;s in it. Not that they <em>get</em> most of it; hopefully the majority can still fly over their heads. But still.</p>

<p>(sigh) Tried to sort out a sibling disagreement. It&#8217;s alarming how staunchly two people will stick to their sides without any willingness to compromise.</p>

<p>Not that that had anything to do with anything.</p>

<p>Anyway.</p>

<p>Went to Anthony&#8217;s for a while this evening. I freaking&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m approaching a semi-critical point. I&#8217;m irritable, and seething. Not at anything in particular (though targets have a way of presenting themselves, unsurprisingly), just&#8230; angry.</p>

<p>So&#8230; idk. I&#8217;m just making a log here.</p>

<p>Oh, I got a phone the other day. Completely on a whim. My work situation has flipped upside down and is scaled up by a factor of twelve, leaving me not a little bit shaken. (And you should see the fulltime employees.) So yeah, I just kind of went to Wireless Advantage and got a phone. $45/mo is expensive, but being able to get a message to anyone whenever is completely worth it. Heh.</p>

<p>And I realized once again that I can&#8217;t remember arbitrary numbers. Making <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/images/453.gif"">a visual</a> worked, actually. Odd as that is.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m so ready to be done with school&#8230; The first two days of the week have absolutely crawled. Three days left. Ha, three days to get my Spanish grade above an F. Though the video project should be fabulous. Will definitely post it when it&#8217;s done.</p>

<p>Baccalaureate was tonight, seven to eightish in the auditorium. Probably 40-50 people there; more than, I think, I expected.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t bad, by any stretch. Music was decent, the program flowed nicely. A drama team from somewhere did what they called &#8220;Human Videos&#8221; &#8211; silent skits performed to a song. Very creative &#8211; excellently done. Kinda want to see if they have a <span class=""caps"">DVD</span> or anything.</p>

<p>But yeah&#8230; idk, it was weird. And I think graduation is going to be weirder for the same reason. It was a group of people, of like mindsets, celebrating on behalf of a group accomplishment. &#8230; I really didn&#8217;t feel a part of that. Don&#8217;t, I mean. This applies to both the Christian community and the graduating class of 2007 &#8211; I&#8217;m <em>in</em> it, yeah, but I don&#8217;t&#8230; idk, associate myself with it?</p>

<p>A weird thing happened today &#8211; senior awards. It was cool to see individuals recognized by their class for what they had done. They cheered me when the National Merit thing came up, and it was weird. One of those situations where you&#8217;re physically there and thanking them for their recognition, but your mind is off to the side, watching how you react. It was weird that they cared, I guess. I wouldn&#8217;t have expected them to.</p>

<p>Which leads in to another facet of my personality that I&#8217;ve been exploring &#8211; another part, specifically, of how/why I interact with people. (And pardon me if this seems like an overly all-about-me entry; you are looking at a blog, after all.) When I choose to interact with people, it&#8217;s because I feel like I need to share <em>me</em> with someone. That&#8217;s not a statement of ego, I just need to be able to get through things with someone I can lean on for a while. I hate feeling that dependency. I don&#8217;t want to put anyone through that (&#8216;that&#8217; being&#8230; idk, me leaning on them, so to speak), so I stay away from people. I suppose I&#8217;m simply avoiding situations where I&#8217;d impose on them. Why would they care? I don&#8217;t care particularly about most of them, in a sense of personal interest.</p>

<p>Which might be where this stems from. A cyclical not caring about self and not caring about others. There are a few people that I care about incredibly, and like everyone else, some things in that respect have worked. Others have been massive failures. But that&#8217;s life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Life. Don&#8217;t talk to me about life.</em><br />

</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s raining outside. We were waiting for Abbey&#8217;s bus to get back in from the all-day field trip; I walked in the rain for a while and sat under an overhang against the school. Ran through names of people I could call, not because I had anything important to talk about, but just to know that for a moment there was someone on the other end that was willing to listen for a minute. Pay attention to me, I guess. That&#8217;s why I blog, I think. Because somewhere on the internet, there has to be <em>someone</em> willing to pay attention. I don&#8217;t really think I&#8217;m worth it. I don&#8217;t give <em>myself</em> the time of day. But some part of me still wants to be heard and cared about. Odd as that sounds.</p>

<p>People that I interact with fall into three categories.</p>

<p>One: I don&#8217;t know you, you don&#8217;t me, it&#8217;s cool. Let&#8217;s have lunch and never see each other again.</p>

<p>Two: You&#8230; seem to want to get to know me. But the feeling, unfortunately, is not mutual. :/ Sorry.</p>

<p>Three: It looks like it might be, this time. I&#8217;ll be there to listen to you, yeah. Of course. But I&#8217;m scared to death that you don&#8217;t really want to listen to me.</p>

<p>And there you are. Or, well, not &#8216;you&#8217;. It would depend.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a photo kind of day.</p>

<p>Also the very last Thursday of my direct involvement with the high school.</p>

<p><em>And all Rhinelander&#8217;s seniors said,</em> &#8220;Amen&#8221;.</p>

<p>Had something of a headache this morning. Diet Coke, a Doubleshot and 4/5 of a Jolt chased that one away. I hadn&#8217;t actually tried Jolt before; wasn&#8217;t bad. A guy at work offered one to me. I opened it up and this liquid-nitrogen-esque gas came pouring out. Pam kind of freaked. :)</p>

<p>This was also my first official day working for <a href=""http://heckcapital.com"">Heck Capital Advisors</a>, nÃ©e The Heck Group (already worked them for a year under that name). I&#8217;m enjoying it. The building is decently photogenic, and having the main hallway lined with lockers is cooler than it sounds. Perks of leasing a remodeled old school.</p>

<p>Was wandering around town with Anthony and Grace a few days ago. No plan, just driving. Passed the middle and high schools. Think it was Anthony that made the comment &#8211; the middle school looks like a prison.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s weird how any given situation can have blatantly obvious problems that go unnoticed, simply because it&#8217;s the norm. I never noticed that about the junior high before.</p>

<p>But it kind of goes for everything. Walmart in particular.</p>

<p>I was there earlier this week. Kinda stopped for a second and looked around. It&#8217;s really a very disturbing place. No one smiles, except the greeter. Or actually no, she doesn&#8217;t smile. Just welcomes you. You pass the doors and the hordes of people sift past you, moving from cheap-edition DVDs to a new display of weight-loss miracles. A friendly female voice comes on the PA every few minutes to ask if you&#8217;re hungry, and to remind you of the goodness of Subway, right here in Walmart.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s <em>disturbing</em>. You watch all the people wander the store kind of in a daze, filling carts, standing in checkout lines. Obeying the voice on the PA. Like a human clearing house.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m done. We&#8217;re done. The class of 2007 is done.</p>

<p>Fricking yeah. Our collective experience in high school has drawn to a close. Are we happy? Of course. Never mind that our class had its senior trip canceled for lack of interest. Never mind that the senior walk was stopped, as was the alternative senior prank &#8211; The Zombie Walk. (Though, to his credit, Jordan <em>did</em> wander around the school with minuscule shorts, a muscle shirt and a purse, shouting &#8220;I&#8217;d rather have them dress like zombies!&#8221;.)</p>

<p>I will say this for my class, though. I identify with them very well. It&#8217;s a capable group, with a lot of potential. Just very, very little ambition. We couldn&#8217;t even get a memorial for a killed classmate off the ground.</p>

<p>Ah, yes. The classmate.</p>

<p>The idea of actually starting a memorial fund has been proposed, considering that <span class=""caps"">RHS</span> has had students pop off on a fairly regular basis. Yes, it&#8217;s horrible to expect something like that. But it makes sense.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got my yearbook here, flipping through it. The cover has what looks to be a a fairy garden on a streetcorner, with the title &#8220;Liberi Fatali&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Children of Fate&#8221;. This doesn&#8217;t strike me as particularly encouraging, and overly fatalistic for a yearbook. But what have you.</p>

<p>Heh, a ton of seniors used the &#8220;shoot for the moon, land among the stars&#8221; quote. Maybe it was the default, idk. I took a cue from <a href=""http://www.savagechickens.com/blog/2005/05/glass-half-empty.html"">Savage Chickens</a>.</p>

<p>Class pictures, departments, clubs, sports. Ads from family businesses, congratulating the class of 2007, and especially their child. Then a couple pages in memorial to the classmates we lost.</p>

<p>Gah. Time. It all comes back to that. Why did Kyle Malone die? Was there a &#8216;why&#8217; to begin with? I&#8217;m looking at his pictures&#8230; (sigh). I wish I had stayed with him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our mind thinks of death<br />
Our heart thinks of life<br />
Our soul thinks of immortality</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Appropriately inspirational, I suppose. And accurate, though I don&#8217;t quite agree with the original author&#8217;s <a href=""http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sri-chinmoy-rose-petals/part1/1.html"">fulltext</a>. Immortality&#8230; sigh. Will I see you again, Kyle? His quote for the yearbook <del>was</del> is &#8220;Never forget&#8221;.</p>

<p>Gah.</p>

<p>Ah well. Moving on. It&#8217;s not a bad yearbook, actually. Still too many typos, but what have you.</p>

<p>So yes. It&#8217;s over.</p>

<p>On to the next.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>Afterthought, for those of you that I know personally &#8211; my grad party will be the 16th. Invitations will happen sometime this weekend. Expect stuff on Facebook, here, and in the mail.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv

<p>It&#8217;s been some time since 97<br />
When you chose to sail away<br />
Now take a seat and stay forever<br />
And make me stop counting the days</p>

<p>Lately I heard you&#8217;re doing well<br />
Though I don&#8217;t know how that feels</p>

<p>Believe in me &#8211; after all<br />
Believe in me &#8211; and hear me call<br />
There&#8217;s a world behind these walls that I just need to see<br />
Believe in me</p>

<p>Every dream that had been shattered<br />
Disappears without a trace<br />
Now that I&#8217;ve found what really matters, yeah<br />
After you had gone away</p>

<p>Even though you had been doing well<br />
Don&#8217;t you hide behind a smile</p>

<p>And just believe in me<br />
Believe in me<br />
Believe in me<br />
Believe in me</p>

<p>Believe in me &#8211; after all<br />
Believe in me &#8211; and hear me call<br />

2007-05-29 04:59:08,Music and Fractal Landscapes,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/471.jpg"" /></p>	<p>An essay, from <em>Dirk Gently&#8217;s Holistic Detective Agency</em>, a work of fiction by Douglas Adams. This particular selection is, within the novel, attributed to the character Richard MacDuff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Music and Fractal Landscapes</strong></p>
<p>Mathematical analysis and computer modeling are revealing to us that the shapes and processes we encounter in nature &#8211; the way plants grow, the way that snowflakes or islands achieve their shapes, the way that light plays on a surface, the way the milk folds and spins into your coffee as you stir it, the way that laughter sweeps through a crowd of people &#8211; all these things in their seemingly magical complexity can be described by the interaction of mathematical processes that are, if anything, even more magical in their simplicity.</p>
<p>Shapes that we think of as random are in fact the products of complex shifting webs of numbers obeying simple rules. The very word &#8220;natural&#8221; that we have often taken to mean &#8220;unstructured&#8221; in fact describes shapes and processes that appear so unfathomably complex that we cannot consciously perceive the simple natural laws at work. They can all be described by numbers.</p>
<p>We know, however, that the mind is capable of understanding these matters in all their complexity and in all their simplicity. A ball flying through the air is responding to the force and direction with which it was thrown, the action of gravity, the friction of the air which it must expend its energy on overcoming, the turbulence of the air around its surface, and the rate and direction of the ball&#8217;s spin.</p>
<p>And yet, someone who might have difficulty consciously trying to work out what 3 &#215; 4 &#215; 5 comes to would have no trouble in doing differential calculus and a whole host of related calculations so astoundingly fast that they can actually catch a flying ball.</p>
<p>People who call this &#8220;instinct&#8221; are merely giving the phenomenon a name, not explaining anything.</p>
<p>I think that the closest that human beings come to expressing our understanding of these natural complexities is in music. It is the most abstract of the arts &#8211; it has no meaning or purpose other than to be itself.</p>
<p>Every single aspect of a piece of music can be represented by numbers. From the organisation of movements in a whole symphony, down through the patterns of pitch and rhythm that make up the melodies and harmonies, the dynamics that shape the performance, all the way down to the timbres of the notes themselves, their harmonics, the way they change over time, in short, all the elements of a noise that distinguish between the sound of one person piping on a piccolo and another one thumping a drum &#8211; all of these things can be expressed by patterns and hierarchies of numbers.</p>
<p>And in my experience the more internal relationships there are between the patterns of numbers at different levels of the hierarchy, however complex and subtle those relationships may be, the more satisfying and, well, whole, the music will seem to be.</p>
<p>In fact the more subtle and complex those relationships, and the further they are beyond the grasp of the conscious mind, the more the instinctive part of your mind &#8211; by which I mean that part of your mind that can do differential calculus so astoundingly fast that it will put your hand in the right place to catch a flying ball &#8211; the more that part of your brain revels in it.</p>
<p>Music of any complexity (and even &#8220;Three Blind Mice&#8221; is complex in its way by the time someone has actually performed it on an instrument with its own individual timbre and articulation) passes beyond your conscious mind into the arms of your own private mathematical genius who dwells in you unconscious responding to all the inner complexities and relationships and proportions that we think we know nothing about.</p>
<p>Some people object to such a view of music, saying that if you reduce music to mathematics, where does the emotion come into it? I would say that it&#8217;s never been out of it.</p>
<p>The things by which our emotions can be moved &#8211; the shape of a flower or a Grecian urn, the way a baby grows, the way the wind brushes across your face, the way clouds mvoe, their shapes, the way light dances on the water, or daffodils flutter in the breeze, the way in which the person you love moves their head, the way their hair follows that movement, the curve described by the dying fall of the last chord of a piece of music &#8211; all these things can be described by the complex flow of numbers.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not a reduction of it, that&#8217;s the beauty of it. Ask Newton. Ask Einstein. Ask the poet (Keats) who said that what the imagination seizes as beauty must be truth. He might also have said that what the hand seizes as a ball must be truth, but he didn&#8217;t, because he was a poet and preferred loafing around under trees with a bottle of laudanum and a notebook to playing cricket, but it would have been equally true.</p>
<p>Because that is at the heart of the relationship between on the one hand our &#8220;instinctive&#8221; understanding of shape, form, movement, light, and on the other hand our emotional responses to them.</p>
<p>And that is why I believe that there must be a form of music inherent in nature, in natural objects, in the patterns of natural processes. A music that would be as deeply satisfying as any naturally occurring beauty &#8211; and our own deepest emotions are, after all, a form of naturally occurring beauty&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sitting out on the end of the sidewalk, looking at pictures, writing updates to ike_slideshow, and toying with my soundcard. This laptop has harman/kardon speakers. I love them. Listening to Boys, by Royksopp (posted below), with the sound equalizer set to &#8216;powerful&#8217; and virtual surround turned on.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful evening. Beautiful sky. I worked until 8:30; wish I had left and gone to take pictures or something. Though this is one of the days where you almost wish you couldn&#8217;t see, if only to avoid the sinking feeling that there&#8217;s far too much beauty than can be sought out.</p>

<p><em>I don&#8217;t know what more to ask for</em><br />
<em>I was given just one wish</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;m rediscovering Royksopp, I think. Great band, and still the one with my defining song &#8211; Only This Moment. Watch <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST2BGQWeOgY"">the video</a> sometime. They&#8217;re&#8230; hrm. The music is intellectual &#8211; many levels of patterns, effects subtly layered and varied to create an all-encompassing soundscape. But the soundscape <em>is</em> all-encompassing &#8211; it can completely take over your mind if you let yourself get lost in it. You can feel the music. Musick.</p>

<p>Interesting things have been happening at work. Not a lot I&#8217;m okay talking about, unfortunately, but dealing with anyone you&#8217;ve left behind makes for an interesting situation. This evidently applies to the workplace as well.</p>

<p>Random thought: I love air conditioning. And driving at dusk during the summer. With air conditioning.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv
2007-06-02 03:32:16,asdf,"<p>It&#8217;s 6:02. I&#8217;m sitting outside of Coffee Beans, doing absolutely nothing. Except blogging. And I might work on ike_slideshow for a while. Or maybe not, idk. It&#8217;s muggy outside.</p>

<p>Graduation is tomorrow. I came <em>this</em> close to not walking&#8230; something about not having all textbooks turned in. Pish posh. I did have seven, but they only knew about three. The guidance department, fortunately, is very flexible. Even at 5:30 on the day before the ceremony.</p>

<p>But yeah&#8230; graduation. Kinda weird to think about. The end of high school &#8211; a good thing. All ties to a mandatory educational institution removed &#8211; good. I don&#8217;t see myself missing this. At all. I mean, it&#8217;s <em>possible</em>... My boss goes on on occasion about how it&#8217;s important to enjoy the senior year and what a blast he had. Or maybe that was college. But either way, he was fairly adamant that I appreciate the final 36 weeks. Heh. I don&#8217;t think I did.</p>

<p>Which is weird, I guess.</p>

<p><code>/me leaves for Hodag Park, on the offchance that there&#39;s wifi there</code></p>

<p><strong>couple hours later</strong></p>

<p>There isn&#8217;t. Which is a shame. That&#8217;d be a cool addition to the <del>city</del> <del>town</del> <del>community</del> locale. Being by the lake with a laptop would be nice.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a question for you &#8211; what is wrong with this code?</p>

<pre><code>$txp = mysql_query( &#34;select ID from `textpattern`&#34; );
</code>
<code>while ( $foo = mysql_fetch_array( $txp ) ) {
echo mysql_query( &#34;update `textpattern` set custom_1=&#39;&#34; . ( !empty( $foo[&#39;custom_1&#39;] ) ? &#39;is &#39; . $foo[&#39;custom_1&#39;] : &#39;(null)&#39; ) . &#34;&#39; where ID=&#39;{$foo[&#39;ID&#39;]}&#39; limit 1&#34; );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Because I ran it to tag on the string &#8216;is &#8216; before all of the not-null custom_1 values, and it freaking emptied them all. ...</p>

<p><code>/me goes to ask network admin for a db backup</code></p>

<p><strong>10:44pm</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;m over at Anthony&#8217;s, burning an iso of some *nix recovery system. Evidently he formatted over a drive with all his photos on. Heh. Poor guy.</p>

<p>So&#8230; yeah&#8230; I purchased a domain from Godaddy &#8211; <em>.info for $.99!</em> &#8211; for yet another side project. It remains to be seen whether or not this, like its three cellmates, will ever see the light of public access.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv

2007-06-03 06:32:19,Thoughts on graduation,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/484.jpg"" /></p>	<p>I suppose from the very beginning, twelve or thirteen years ago, today was just as inevitable as it was at the beginning of this year. The day when, as far as the public eye is concerned, another crop of hopeful adolescents takes a hopefully confident step out of tax-funded education. To the parents, it&#8217;s the day when eighteen years of hard work and a stream of unreasonably high bills sees an officially recognized result. To the students themselves, who have been counting down the days since September, it&#8217;s the final, signed-in-blood promise that compulsory education and curfews are out the door. Well, mostly.</p>

<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve watched this approach for years that it&#8217;s not quite as&#8230; hm, overwhelmingly joyous. Or something. A part of me would pass over the entire thing and say that, while it is a celebration of accomplishment, it&#8217;s the same celebration of the same accomplishment that the general public has sweated through for who knows how many years. An acknowledgment that you, after all, reached the standards set forth for you. Well done.</p>

<p>Though it is more than that, I suppose. Jessica made the point in her speech (which compared the class to fireworks and graduation to their explosion; a metaphor which bothers me, because it&#8217;s all downhill for the firework after that) that, while people have been doing this for years, getting through the first eighteen years of life and education (well, thirteen years of that) is a significant accomplishment worth commending.</p>

<p>Which it is, of course. My congratulations to all of you who end up reading this. We&#8217;ve gotten through.</p>

<p>Heh. &#8220;We&#8217;ve gotten through.&#8221; It occurs to me that that&#8217;s a particularly good way to put it for the class of &#8217;07, one where the school valedictorian doesn&#8217;t give a speech, the class president is barred from walking in the ceremony, and one of our own dies in a car crash. Collectively, yes, we&#8217;ve gotten through. That&#8217;s not to say that we haven&#8217;t sustained damages, but yes, we&#8217;ve gotten through.</p>

<p>So, here&#8217;s to a future where we, like our parents and theirs and so on, go out into the world, find jobs, reproduce and get our kids through secondary education so they can start their part of the cycle. Now there&#8217;s a thought: perhaps graduation is significant <em>because</em> we&#8217;ve achieved our part of the cycle &#8211; doing anything else would drag down society. We&#8217;re doing our part to keep the culture going.</p>

<p>Though more importantly, here&#8217;s to a future where our generation <em>does</em> do some cool things. I don&#8217;t see world peace happening anytime soon, but hey &#8211; we&#8217;ve got enough ability to make some kind of mark on the earth. God willing, it&#8217;ll be a good one.</p>

<p>A very long time ago (here meaning &#8220;at least January, according to my logs&#8221;), another concept slipped its way between Prospork and a side project that&#8217;s still in the works and is not ready to unveil. Its name was Workplace Confessional.</p>

<p>The concept was simple. A spot for people to work out their frustrations from the workplace in an environment where others would be able to (1) empathize with them, and (2) mock them for being so weak. Or something. Like Dilbert and <a href=""http://worsethanfailure.com"">Worse than Failure</a> combined.</p>

<p>Anthony and I tossed that one around for a while, and like the-other-project-that-shall-not-be-named, nothing really happened with it. I <em>did</em> find a really excellent <a href=""http://www.sxc.hu/photo/325650"">photo</a> to use for the header, though.</p>

<p>And now, at far too early an hour for my taste, <span class=""caps"">WPC</span> has found its way into the light. The harsh, florescent break-room light, glaring with the bitterness of a nation&#8217;s underpaid and overworked employees. Or something.</p>

<p>Anyway. Point is, Workplace Confessional is online. <a href=""http://workplaceconfessional.com""><strong>workplaceconfessional.com</strong></a>. Anthony wrote the user agreement. :)</p>

<p>I should point out that it&#8217;s not quite finished yet. Everything that&#8217;s there is perfectly functional, but not everything has made it online.</p>

<p>That being said, keep a weather eye on the horizon for features and whatnot. But until then, feel free to use the thing &#8211; post your stories of woe and hilarity at the Workplace Confessional.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv

<p>Got to bed at nine last night. I either stay up until late (here meaning &#8220;somewhere between midnight and two&#8221;) or cash it in early. Nine is early.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[23:28] ikebowen: gah. really don&#8217;t want to sleep<br />
[23:28] Anthony: me either<br />
[23:28] Anthony: well, I dont want to go to sleep<br />
[23:28] Anthony: but I want to sleep</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty much sums it up. I&#8217;m trying sleeping pills to see if they help.</p>

<p>(Before I continue, you should know that I already wrote something to the effect of the following before and accidentally closed it. I&#8217;m annoyed.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m at work, right, looking at <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/images/488.jpg"">this map</a> (from <a href=""http://www.weather.com/outlook/events/sports/map/interactive/54501?from=36hour_map_large&#38;zoom=6&#38;interactiveMapLayer=radar&#38;animation=false"">weather.com</a>).</p>

<p>Me: Looks like the rest of the world has really great weather. Either that, or this map only has data for the US.<br />
Co-worker 1: Oh <em>good</em>. I envy Moscow.<br />
Co-worker 2: Especially because we <em>owned</em> them in the Cold War&#8230;</p>

<p>But yeah. I&#8217;d like to state this for the record:</p>

<p>America &#8211; you are stupid.</p>

<p>And wrong. Well, largely.</p>

<p>This is about Pirates <span class=""caps"">III</span> and some of the reviews it&#8217;s gotten, just so you can take that in context. And I&#8217;m not going to work in critic comments because I already <em>did</em> that before I lost what I wrote. Imagine that this paragraph contains excerpts from a few different critics and me lambasting them for being silly.</p>

<p>The gist of it is this &#8211; Pirates <span class=""caps"">III</span> is not the kind of end-of-a-franchise film that America likes. It&#8217;s not the one that makes the audience go, &#8220;oh, I get it. I&#8217;m glad that&#8217;s settled.&#8221; It&#8217;s not the one where the guy and the girl make the relationship work, and where the bad guys are taken care of. Pirates <span class=""caps"">III</span> comes completely full-circle, and I mean that almost literally. The series introduces you to a selection of characters, then spends a few hours showing you who they really are &#8211; exploring their characters in myriad circumstances. This final film takes that, ties together all of the threads that the first two movies began, and throws it back up into the air for the audience to catch. So to speak. Perhaps a more appropriate metaphor would be the audience watching the threads fly/fall through the air. ... Well, maybe.</p>

<p>Yes, the film is complicated. Yes, more characters are developed than is typical for a cinematic hit. But that&#8217;s the beauty of it &#8211; it <em>is</em> complicated and it totally makes sense. If your mind hasn&#8217;t been dulled by eight-second advertising clips and the media. And if you don&#8217;t like the film, you&#8217;re probably American anyway.</p>

<p>I took a couple notes on my phone during the film &#8211; <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/images/489.jpg"">here</a> and <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/images/490.jpg"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>guitar</strong><br />
This is the first film in the series to have a guitar solo in the soundtrack. Well done, Hans.</p>

<p><strong>bodz sinking on a flag</strong><br />
Meant to say &#8220;body&#8221;. I gave up on the intelligent keypad thing a while ago&#8230;. Yeah, anyway, this film has a fair number of images that stick with you. Places in the movie where the audio and visual combine to make something powerful (the guitar solo was one). This particular shot is underwater, looking up at a body, slightly spreadeagled, sinking down and weighing down a broad, white flag. Very cool.</p>

<p><strong>bootstrap smeagol</strong><br />
Interestingly, Bootstrap Bill (as a natural human, without the barnacles and prolific starfish) looks much like <a href=""http://www.serkis.com/"">Andy Serkis</a> (warning &#8211; audio) of LoTR/Gollum fame.</p>

<p><strong>parallels</strong><br />
There are many.</p>

<p><strong>completion left undone</strong><br />
<strong>full circle</strong><br />
<strong>promise</strong><br />
These phrases more or less completely describe the film. And you&#8217;ll really have to watch it to know what I&#8217;m talking about. I&#8217;m not motivated enough to re-write everything I had in here before. :)</p>

<p>Davy Jones, by the way, rises above every other film character that I&#8217;ve seen as the one I can most identify with. This may seem odd to you, given that I don&#8217;t appear to be cruel and tentacle-ridden. But&#8230; yeah. Just thought I&#8217;d throw that out there.</p>

<p>This was a good movie. Spiderman <span class=""caps"">III</span>, Pirates <span class=""caps"">III</span>. Both excellent conclusions to a franchise. Favorite <del>part</del> <del>trait</del> part of this one: <em>musick</em> plays a role. An important role.</p>

<p>I love Davy Jones.</p>

<p>This is one of those not quite hot, not quite muggy days. The ones that you get in Chicago and Dallas, where the skyline turns into washed-out pastels.</p>

<p>Rhinelander, regrettably, has no skyline that can really be considered artful. Unless you count the old drive-in, which is where I ended up after work at around 7. The airport thereafter. Anthony has this spot up on the hill where you can watch the planes land and take off.</p>

<p>The first two shots are slightly out of the ordinary for me, largely for what I did with the color/luminosity in each shot. Bear with me.</p>

<p>But yeah, idk. None of those are really that great. Today feels&#8230; a little hesitant, maybe. Or not hesitant, perhaps just reluctant. Part of it might be the weather; there&#8217;s been storm cells over Wisconsin, but not in Rhinelander. Oddly. And contrary to forecast.</p>

<p>Spent most of the day filling out paperwork for new brokerage accounts, trusts and <span class=""caps"">IRA</span>s. People with money are an interesting breed. But then, so is everyone. Geeks, too. When not plugging in ssns, there were computers to switch in and out of cases.</p>

<p>Oh, heh. Someone ordered a massive server cabinet. The thing weighs 320lbs. The <span class=""caps"">UPS</span> guy wasn&#8217;t pleased. To his credit, though, he pulled off a flawless back-up job with the semi.</p>

<p>Sigh. I&#8217;m terribly behind in everything. FreeTXP applications are stacking up, I still have loan applications to do for college, and my room is a mess. It&#8217;s a relief to not have to plan my school week. Much easier to just live day-to-day. I think this is evidence that I&#8217;ll need to be employed, rather than be an employer. I&#8217;m not sure I could handle management. Planning and persistence and ambition and whatnot.</p>

<p>Oh&#8230; what else&#8230; ike_slideshow officially has been downloaded 824 times, a number that doesn&#8217;t represent any great milestone, but is at least larger than 12. The most creative use I&#8217;ve seen involves packing materials and the aesthetic display thereof. To each his own.</p>

<p>A second McDonalds is opening up in town&#8230; sigh. Blasted Americans. Though I am one, so I probably shouldn&#8217;t talk.

We got the thing from EOJohnson as a substitute for the main copier until it could be fixed. Ironically, the replacement&#8217;s been far less reliable than the original. We use them both. Today&#8217;s issue was its power system. Evidently it&#8217;s running out of ways to jam and/or break &#8211; it literally blew a fuse this time. And not even the Office Equipment Messiah was able to fix it. That&#8217;d be a co-worker of mine, able to heal broken staplers by laying his hands upon them.

2007-06-14 04:36:54,Notepad2 -> Notepad in Vista,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/509.jpg"" /></p>	<p>This is probably something of a specific circumstance, but just in case anyone is in the same bind, this may be of some value.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html"">Notepad2</a> &#8211; a great <code>notepad.exe</code> replacement from Flo&#8217;s Freeware. I&#8217;ve been using it for eons. Give or take. The problem comes in when you want to replace Window&#8217;s vanilla Notepad with this new-and-shiny rendition, for while it&#8217;s easy enough to locate <code>notepad.exe</code> to overwrite it, Vista&#8217;s cleverly-positioned permissions system gets squarely in the way. One might think that running <code>copy</code> from the administrative commandline (flag+r, <code>cmd</code>) might work, but no.</p>

<p>The most obvious solution would be to assign the current user administrative privileges for the files in question. The obvious problem with that is that Vista blocks any such attempt. :) Curiously, however, the OS has <em>no</em> problem with the current user assigning itself as owner of a file. This seems odd to me, but that&#8217;s the way it works.</p>

<p>Thus, the process:</p>

<p><strong>To replace Vista&#8217;s <code>notepad.exe</code> with Notepad2</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>First off &#8211; unzip Notepad2 (<a href=""http://www.flos-freeware.ch/zip/notepad2.zip"">download</a>) somewhere and rename the executable to <code>notepad.exe</code> (or just <code>notepad</code> if you can&#8217;t see the file extension to begin with).</li>
<li>Open up <code>C:Windows</code> (easiest way: flag+r, &#8220;C:Windows&#8221;)</li>
<li>Find <code>notepad.exe</code>; right-click and select the &#8220;Security&#8221; tab</li>
<li>Click &#8220;Advanced&#8221;</li>
<li>Open the &#8220;Owner&#8221; tab; click the &#8220;Edit&#8221; button</li>
<li>Select the current user from the list of names</li>
<li>OK, OK, OK, OK</li>
<li>Find wherever you put the newly-renamed copy of Notepad2 &#8211; copy it, then paste it into <code>C:Windows</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Repeat the above with <code>C:Windowssystem32</code> and the copy of <code>notepad.exe</code> therein.</p>

<p>Heh. That would be the third time I&#8217;ve seen &#8216;onerous&#8217; since english lit with Bronson.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to go on about the week (largely for fear of placing this site among the ranks of the whiny-myspace-esque), but I will say that&#8230; hm. Being a part of a new firm that&#8217;s amassing ridiculously large sums of invested capital is&#8230; arduous. :) I&#8217;ve gone though somehting like four Sobe Adrenalines, three lattes, a Jolt and innumerable Dews on roughly 30 hours of sleep for the week. ... And it wasn&#8217;t even <em>good</em> sleep.</p>

<p>On an unrelated note, I went and saw Spiderman <span class=""caps"">III</span> again last night. If you&#8217;ve seen the film, recall the news anchor in the second-to-the-last fight scene. The one who says that it may be a grim day for New York (or something to that effect). He reminded me very strongly of some other film character at the first viewing; couldn&#8217;t think who, though. Took another showing for me to catch it.</p>

<p>He looks precisely like Admiral Ackbar in human form.</p>

<p>(Ignore the bit about the bar room floor&#8230;)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking out at Lake Esadore, through the glass doors at my grandparents&#8217; cabin. Cottage. Thing. I&#8217;m not sure if anyone&#8217;s given the edifice a name since it was built. The hybrid garage-house in the back goes by &#8220;the Bunkhouse&#8221;.</p>

<p>I love my cousins. (There&#8217;s one in the photo up there.) Never seems like we have enough time together, but that&#8217;s kind of how it goes with the people you care about. I&#8217;m here with three of my sibs; we followed the exodus after the party last night. Ethan and Aaron went in their car; I took Aaron, Winston (cousin) and Winston&#8217;s dad. Heh, we watched Battlefront Galactica on the way down. Jacked the laptop into the car&#8217;s soundsystem. Perks of being a geek.</p>

<p>But yeah, the party. Only half the people found the guestbook; I&#8217;d put the total attendance at something between 50 and 80, filtering in and out. (Upd: closer to 80.) Few people from church, a few from school, work, and a decent portion of the familial clan. Kevin, Matthew, Stephanie and Anthony represented the class of 2006. Nice to have them there.</p>

<p>It was something a relief, honestly, that the general attendance didn&#8217;t&#8230; engulf me. :) I can handle parties when I have to, but not so much when I&#8217;m the focus. I fortunately wasn&#8217;t. I mean, yeah, I was, but not to a ridiculous extent. If that makes sense.</p>

<p>Anyway.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no wireless here. Or any other sort of broadband access. I think I&#8217;m twitching.</p>

<p>We (&#8220;we&#8221; being &#8220;the guys&#8221;) watched Spiderman <span class=""caps"">III</span> last night. Hooray for Demonoid. The DivX wasn&#8217;t bad, but the torrent looked to be a <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=screener"">screener</a> masquerading as an actual <span class=""caps"">DVD</span> rip. The cover jpg was definitely a fake.</p>

<p>Random note: a MySpace newsletter went out, serving mostly as a reminder to me that I haven&#8217;t yet deactivated my account there. And oddly, the newsletter didn&#8217;t suck. It actually looked okay, only because they used a visual theme other than what&#8217;s used on myspace.com. Go figure. And if you&#8217;ve never watched the Myspace music video from Eleventyseven, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5Vm7hKv6sE&#38;v3"">do it now</a>.</p>

<p>I just finished going through the gifts and cards from the grad party. An unexpectedly nice feeling. Everything from straws and sporks (Emma&#8230; ha) to luggage to 101 Things To Do With Ramen Noodles. Classy. Thanks to all of you who attended and/or gifted something &#8211; you are very much appreciated and valued. Actually, you&#8217;re probably very much appreciated and valued whether you sent something in or not, but your gifts were also nice. ;) Thank-you cards are forthcoming; haven&#8217;t decided what to do with those. They may involve duct tape.</p>

<p><strong><del>fINAL</del> final thoughts</strong>
<ul>
<li>My uncle Glenn filled up the Intrepid&#8217;s tank as a gift. :) Very appropriate, <em>very</em> appreciated.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve racked up an obscene amount in overdraft fees. It&#8217;s killing me (killing me). Going to call the bank; wasn&#8217;t aware that their fee structure functioned like this&#8230; <code>/me grimaces</code></li>
<li>Caught up last night on the sleep lost over the last week. Roughly eleven hours, interrupted occasionally by people related to me.</li>
<li>The holes in my favorite jeans can no longer be ignored. This is a sad day.</li>
<li>Rain would be nice right about now&#8230;</li>

2007-06-18 20:37:24,A stream of thought,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/515.jpg"" /></p>	<p>It actually did rain today. I can&#8217;t tell if it still is or not; am parked in the basement for the night. Someone filched my fan.</p>

<p>I kind of miss it. It was (is!) small and chrome-like. With a little black toggle switch on the back. It made a satisfied little humming noise. I&#8217;ll find it one day.</p>

<p>Until then, I&#8217;ll be in the basement. Which isn&#8217;t all bad, mind you. I still have my dad&#8217;s projector down here; 12-foot widescreen is fun. :) Which brings up the question of why I&#8217;m lying on the floor with my neck at an awkward angle, trying to see the laptop screen and keep my hands on the keys, instead of <em>using</em> the projector. It probably has something to do with the effort involved in standing.</p>

<p>In unrelated news, the copier at work is gay. Definitively gay, not as a derogatory cut. We concluded this after finding a lilac-colored lace/ribbon cloth in its own little compartment, theoretically for cleaning the scan bed. ... What kind of equipment comes with <em>anything</em> edged in lace?</p>

<p>We might have expected it, though. That particular copier had to have its own <del>issues</del> differences; the other copier has already made its reputation as an eccentric. Among its other <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=undocumented%20feature"">undocumented features</a>, it seems to analyze the user&#8217;s personality. I do not lie &#8211; extroverts get their copies delivered to the external tray and introverts find theirs in the internal tray beneath the scan bed. Honest. A co-worker queued up a job while mine was printing &#8211; mine was delivered without fuss to the internal tray, and his job (queued with precisely the same settings as mine, mind you) ended up in the external. Not even the resident Office Equipment Diety knew why. (He&#8217;s an extrovert.)</p>

<p>By the way, does anyone else think it&#8217;s ridiculous that the Google customized homepage is called <a href=""http://igoogle.com"">iGoogle</a>?</p>

<p>The <span class=""caps"">COO</span> was gone today. Ergo, I wore no tie.</p>

<p>And was firmly told off for it.</p>

<p>On some level, it&#8217;s amusing that a tie is so <em>very</em> critical to business. If you&#8217;re male, a tie is the difference between professional and casual dress. If you&#8217;re not male, a tie isn&#8217;t even considered. (What&#8217;s the distinguishing factor of female professional dress, anyway? Heels? Or are the heels just for the sake of the professional males?)</p>

<p>On another level, the fact that someone else cared about my tie (or lack thereof) means that things have begun to calm down. The wearing of ties is now back on the list of things to be concerned about. Never mind the transfer of several hundred million in various trusts, <span class=""caps"">IRA</span>s and the like. Are you wearing your tie?</p>

<p><strong>peeve of the week</strong></p>

<p>Sites designed particularly for IE 6. To the extent that they break horribly in both IE 7 and Firefox. &#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s wrong with this website?&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s not the site, it&#8217;s your browser. (think: Any other day it&#8217;d be pebkac&#8230;) You&#8217;re far too up-to-date for the thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The site in question will go unnamed, just because it&#8217;s workplace-related, but it shocks me that the software in the finance industry is so&#8230; <em>bad</em>. There are a couple exceptions, of course (though the only one that comes to mind uses the IE rendering engine, making it inherently flawed), but most of it just flat-out sucks. Bad UIs, odd database schemas, inconsistent behaviors. It&#8217;s <em>terrible</em>, and it makes you wonder why <em>finance</em>, of all sectors, can&#8217;t seem to get good, solid software. It&#8217;s not like they can&#8217;t afford it.</p>

<p>The answer to that is probably very simple, and goes along the lines of &#8220;the end-users can&#8217;t tell good software when they see it, and most of them aren&#8217;t complaining about the state of the software they&#8217;re getting now, so why work harder when they pay our exhorbant fees anyway?&#8221;.</p>

<p>Mediocrity: It takes a lot less time and most people won&#8217;t notice the difference until it&#8217;s too late. (<a href=""http://despair.com/med24x30prin.html"">Despair Inc</a>)</p>

I just got back from the play in Three Lakes &#8211; The Sound of Music. Wonderfully done. Excellent. [larger list of superlatives goes here] Also, I love nuns. The noun, the location, the occupation, the&#8230; erm, something. And they sing. Or, well, they sing in movies and plays. And the nuns in the play sang beautifully. The first act opened with the nuns entering in front of a closed black curtain, with something like eight red lights shining down onto the curtain, creating the effect of red columns of light. Great effect. Didn&#8217;t hurt that I love chantsong to begin with. Will have to post some of that sometime&#8230;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s roughly 2:30 on Wednesday. My timesheet has 34 hours on it so far.</p>

<p>The guys are out at meetings for the next couple days, leaving us to do whatever we do anyway, but with permission to call it quits at 4:30. There&#8217;s something slightly wrong when the contract says half-past four, but no one even thinks about leaving until at least 5:15.</p>

<p>Shredder-repair-guy just walked in. We&#8217;ve had terrible fortune &#8211; have I mentioned this? &#8211; with office equipment. Gay copiers, copiers with personality complexes, and a shredder has decided what it wanted all along was to be one of those fun little decorative edge-trimmer things that scrapbookers are crazy about. Also, I plugged in headphones to my computer the other day and it rebooted. Twice, and apparently in direct consequence. Does that make any sense?</p>

<p>Sigh. I&#8217;m waiting to ask a co-worker about a project, but she&#8217;s been spazzing more than usual. Slightly afraid to enter her field of vision at the moment.</p>

<p>Two Sobes, not enough coffee, Dew and twelve hours of sleep for two days. Sounds a little like an indie film.</p>

<p>I think I&#8217;m allowed to go home early today. After pulling what nearly amounted to an all-nighter yesterday. It&#8217;s Abbey&#8217;s birthday today, and I have absolutely no idea what to do for her. She&#8217;s eleven, I think, and a beautiful little girl. She deserves a better big brother.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Upd: The shredder is fixed. This is more notable news than one might think; the first guy who came told us that, frankly, he had no idea how to take the thing apart.</p>

Worked until noon, spent an hour or so with Anthony, brought my laptop home so a sibling fallen ill could play Battle for Middle Earth II, got a haircut, went to Matthew&#8217;s for an hour, did a random assortment of things at Meg&#8217;s grad party (the cake wasn&#8217;t actually that random), and &#8211; oddly &#8211; went to see Ratatouille with Nathan. And Nathan&#8217;s mom and brother.</p>

<p>12:02. New week.</p>

<p>Life has not been so terribly grand. I won&#8217;t lie. Not that it&#8217;d matter if I did, nor would it have virtually any effect on anything. I&#8217;m tired, lonely and depressed. Not necessarily in that order.</p>

<p>Heh, it&#8217;s interesting. I was on my way home from Meg&#8217;s party, after dropping off Dylan and a couple DVDs from Trig&#8217;s. Was not doing so great. It was actually physically hard to keep the accelerator pushed down. I pulled over for a couple minutes, before the intersection at the ice arena. Just kind of sat there.</p>

<p>Concluding that to be a useless exercise (or whatever), I pulled out and started back home. Nathan called, roughly twenty yards past said intersection. And told me to turn around and come to the theatre. Right this moment.</p>

<p>Mm. I have not been more thankful for a phone call in a very, very long time. Thanks, God. Perfect timing.</p>

<p>So, now, it&#8217;s further past midnight than it was before. Which isn&#8217;t saying a whole lot. My evenings tend to do that.</p>

<p>Checking my mail&#8230; evidently the <span class=""caps"">IIT</span> orientation <em>is</em> in July, and&#8230; hm. I seem to have missed the registration deadlines for every session except the one from the 19th through the 20th. Not sure if it&#8217;s worth the trip or not. Chicago is closer than Boston, but gas still isn&#8217;t cheap. I&#8217;ll have to tell Financial Aid about my local scholarships at some point&#8230; wonder if they&#8217;ll dock my offer. Hope not.</p>

<p>On into another week. I&#8217;m still tired and depressed, but a little less lonely at the moment. Thanks Nate.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv

<p>I have a very serious problem taking seriously anything that isn&#8217;t presented well. Web content, live productions, print publications&#8230; anything. This comes to mind every time I&#8217;m at the church, where the people and content are very real, but the presentation is&#8230; lacking? Less than perfect handouts (Publisher can only go so far), music that isn&#8217;t perfectly scripted, a Power Point guy that isn&#8217;t perfectly in sync with the world&#8230; bah.</p>

<p>Presentation is <em>everything</em> to me. It&#8217;s <em>incredibly</em> important. If the content that you&#8217;re trying to deliver isn&#8217;t polished, why the heck are you trying to get someone&#8217;s attention with it?</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv

2007-07-03 20:12:26,a slightly odd thing,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/534.jpg"" /></p>	<p><strong>warning</strong><br />
The following is geeky. If that&#8217;s not you, try the new-and-shiny <a href=""/photog"">photog section</a>. There are pictures.</p>

<p><strong>and now, our feature presentation</strong><br />
In theory, the following code should fill a hard drive to the brim.</p>

<pre><code>while ( 1 &#60; 2 )
file_put_contents( &#34;foo.txt&#34;, rand( 0, 1 ) . &#34;n&#34; );
</code></pre>

<p>However, in most cases, it will not. This is because of the friendly little <code>max_execution_time</code> that a good server technician will keep firmly set at 30 seconds. More power to them.</p>

<p>Except that it doesn&#8217;t seem to always work. Completely out of curiosity (okay, well, I wanted to see how much output I could generate), I ran the following code:</p>

<pre><code>$foo = md5( $foo );
while ( 1 &#60; 2 )
echo( &#34;$foon&#34; );
</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s not entirely correct, actually. I&#8217;m still running it. It&#8217;s been going for a good 10 minutes thus far. The output looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>acbd18db4cc2f85cedef654fccc4a4d8
acbd18db4cc2f85cedef654fccc4a4d8
acbd18db4cc2f85cedef654fccc4a4d8

<p>Good for absolutely nothing, except demonstrating that server operating parameters aren&#8217;t quite as set-in-stone as one might think. Interestingly, the script breaks (and by &#8220;breaks&#8221; I mean &#8220;works properly&#8221;) when <code>echo</code> is replaced with <code>file_put_contents</code> (or its <span class=""caps"">PHP</span> 4 equivalent), in effect writing the output to a file rather than to the browser. The execution time limit jumps in the way, as it should.</p>

<p><strong>few minutes later</strong><br />
Had things gone as expected, this entry would have closed here with something like &#8220;x megs and counting&#8221;. Heh. Firefox crashed when I tried to copy what the script had thus far generated. Going to try this again in a more isolated environment&#8230;</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re so inclined, try running the following script and see how far you get.</p>

<pre><code>header( &#34;content-disposition: attachment&#34; );
$foo = md5( &#34;foo&#34; );
while ( 1 &#60; 2 )
echo( &#34;$foon&#34; );
</code></pre>

<p>33.7megs and counting, at 36kbps. That&#8217;s a lot of acbd18db4cc2f85cedef654fccc4a4d8.</p>

<p><strong>days later</strong><br />
Running it again. 305.4mb, no sign of stopping.</p>

<p>I tried the following, just to see precisely how long it&#8217;d keep the game up:</p>

<pre><code>header( &#34;content-disposition: attachment&#34; );
$foo = time();
while ( 1 &#60; 2 )
echo( time() - $foo . &#34;n&#34; );
</code></pre>

<p>A quote from Lewis Black, taken more or less completely out of context.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s Friday morning. Nathan stopped in last night, left around 11. It never fails &#8211; I take a sleeping pill, and Nathan calls. Heh. Great guy. He declined food on the grounds that he&#8217;s partially photosynthetic, which poses a problem when he works at the theatre.</p>

<p>Oddly, it feels like Monday again. This bothers me. <em>Yesterday</em> felt like Monday. Which is also bothersome, because it means that a single day can feel sufficiently enough like my entire weekend to throw me off. I guess that&#8217;s what working here does to you.</p>

<p>Sent a letter last night to the therapist I was seeing. I&#8217;m done with therapy &#8211; final decision. Not going back. Well, for a while. Maybe something in Chicago. It wasn&#8217;t hard to talk to the guy; just difficult to see a point or derive any benefit from doing so. There was the occasional epiphany, yes, but nothing that couldn&#8217;t have been achieved by talking to someone less expensive. &#8230; I hope my insurance covered all that.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a sobe on the corner of my desk. Couple ounces left.</p>

<p>Curious phenomenon, that. Meaning blogging. Like&#8230; like an arena. (Excuse me while I wax contemplative.) An arena jammed with people, each one jumping and screaming and waving their hands, trying to get the attention of the others. There are collectives here and there &#8211; avoid that corner, that&#8217;s Myspace &#8211; and in a few spots there&#8217;s a person sitting alone against the wall, whispering to the madness.</p>

<p>The logic &#8211; logic, though? &#8211; is that there&#8217;s got to be someone in there who will listen long enough, just meet your gaze for a moment, to give your existence some kind of worth. Enough to let you think you mean something, anything, to someone else.</p>

<p>Why do <del>they</del> we try so hard to scrap significance from people like us? Why is the attention of a peer worth anything at all?</p>

2007-07-07 17:02:04,And we join our hero...,"<p>Ha, no. Our hero crashed and burned, and the series was ended. Forget the hero bit.</p>

<p>I caved. Added an ext3 and a swap partition to my laptop&#8217;s hard drive, threw in Ubuntu. I know. My first warning sign was having no idea where to open the terminal from&#8230; In my defense, installing Ubuntu was largely because of <a href=""http://hook.freetxp.com"">hook&#8217;s</a> review of the os, and coming from a guy who scored more os&#8217;s than gf&#8217;s <em>far</em> before I did, it had some weight. (More power to you, man.)</p>

<p>Installed <span class=""caps"">KDE</span> without mishap, loaded it. I was pleasantly surprised that the OS worked well with my wireless card. My reaction was less positive at its near-total lack of communication with the sound device. The little audio level wheel works perfectly (a little level indicator even pops up), but no sound. Blast.</p>

<p>And it looks like I&#8217;ll need to be fixing that, because for some reason my Vista installation is toast. Lightly toasted, mind you &#8211; it&#8217;ll boot, but only up to the point where it loads the gui. It then, decisively, goes into a coma. Imagine toast in a coma. Yeah. That&#8217;s my laptop.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s exceedingly odd is that precisely the same thing happens with the Vista boot CD that the machine came with. It boots, but only until it loads the gui. This last time it managed to pull the cursor into action, but that&#8217;s it.</p>

<p>Blast.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m downloading <a href=""http://xubuntu.org/"">Xubuntu</a> now, just because it&#8217;s cleaner and doesn&#8217;t come with several thousand preloaded packages. Methinks I&#8217;ll just install that as primary, tweak it as needed. Reinstall Vista somewhere. Wonder when someone&#8217;ll figure out how to use the Zune with Linux&#8230;</p>

It&#8217;s fixed. And don&#8217;t get Xubuntu. The next article goes into further detail on both counts.</p>

2007-07-08 07:47:18,"Adventures with an A200, Vista and Ubuntu","<p><strong>part one &#8211; the mistake</strong><br />
One of the multitudinous differences (yes, that&#8217;s a word; I&#8217;m as surprised as you are) between Vista and XP is this fun little bootloader thing. Vista has its own bootloader.</p>

<p>This is probably entirely irrelevant, but I&#8217;ve chosen to place the blame for Vista&#8217;s current menopausal behavior squarely on the bootloader&#8217;s shoulders. Or boots, perhaps.</p>

<p>The mistake probably went as far back as ordering a copy of Ubuntu from Canonical, with such timing as it arrived more or less in time to fix its steely gaze upon my laptop while it was still shrinkwrapped. I had no choice, you see.</p>

<p>Popped in GParted, nudged the Vista <span class=""caps"">NTFS</span> partition off into the corner, added an ext3 and a swap, and installed Ubuntu. Worked brilliantly &#8211; recognized my wireless card and everything. Not finding quite everything I needed, though, I went back to boot Vista.</p>

<p>And encountered my very first Black Screen Of Death, which I affectionately refer to as the <span class=""caps"">BLASOD</span>.</p>

<p><strong>part two &#8211; the second mistake</strong><br />
So &#8211; Vista wouldn&#8217;t load. To its credit, Vista <em>did</em> scroll the little loading graphic for a while before passing out. Kinda like making you a cup of tea before, say, shooting you in the forehead.</p>

<p>Me being the clever boy I am, I concluded that it should be easily fixed by first removing Ubuntu and then expanding the Vista partition to its original size. This was the second mistake. Bullets should not be removed with q-tips.</p>

<p>Ubuntu comes with its own bootloader, which upon installation maliciously takes over the <acronym title=""Master Boot Record""><span class=""caps"">MBR</span></acronym>. The upshot of this is that, while you get geek points for having it there, its removal will render your other OS(&#8216;s) completely crippled and gazing at you with that bleeding puppy look.</p>

<p>(Clarification: I have never caused a puppy to bleed in any fashion. Ever. But if I had, it would look like what Vista looks like now, only without twitching quite as much.)</p>

<p>So yes, I removed Ubuntu. But &#8211; clever me &#8211; GParted couldn&#8217;t expand Vista&#8217;s filesystem &#8211; it hadn&#8217;t been shut down properly. My bad.</p>

<p><strong>part three &#8211; look! something shiny!</strong><br />
At this point, I&#8217;d more or less given up on fixing Vista and had more or less decided to pull my music and photos off of Vista and  and reformat. Further, I had my eye on this fun little Xubuntu distro, which is <em>like</em> Ubuntu, but naked. I discovered this when it did <em>not</em> recognize my networking equipment out of the box.</p>

<p>Installed Ubuntu for the second time in hours, trying to ignore how self-righteous the three little people in the logo suddenly appeared. Blasted little people.</p>

<p>Which brings me to right about now, as I&#8217;m copying stuff from the Vista partition on over to Ubuntu in light of the impending reformat. The original plan was to back up to this 200gb <span class=""caps"">NTFS</span> drive I have, but I&#8217;d forgotten that Linux doesn&#8217;t play well with that particular format. Or vice versa. I&#8217;m banking on the fact that my Zune has all of my music on it. Something had better not go wrong there.</p>

<p><strong>part four &#8211; /slap</strong><br />
It&#8217;s a good thing I&#8217;m uncertain, fearful, and in possession of a Windows XP boot disk. Or I just might have killed off Vista entirely.</p>

<p><del>I&#8217;m not</del> I&#8217;m going to bore you with the important details just in case there&#8217;s anyone else out there trying to dualboot Ubuntu and Vista who&#8217;s discovered crcdisk.sys giving the system a bsod or a black screen. Yes, that last sentence was keyword-laden.</p>

<p>The solution, as revealed on the <a href=""http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2472228#post2472228"">Ubuntu forums</a>, is fairly simple. Boot to the XP disk, jump to the repair thing (hit <code>R</code>), choose the Windows installation in question, type in a random password three times (make sure you don&#8217;t use the correct password; that&#8217;d be bad), reboot. Boot to Safe Mode with Command Prompt (tap F8 a few times right as Vista starts). It&#8217;ll run into a brick wall of sorts when crcdisk.sys is loaded, which is fine. Let it churn. It&#8217;ll reboot at some point; Vista should then be fixed. Enjoy.</p>

<p><strong>part five &#8211; the end</strong><br />
I&#8217;m an idiot. And I&#8217;m all thrown off now &#8211; Ubuntu doesn&#8217;t do cursor acceleration quite the same as Vista.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv

<p>I&#8217;m at Anthony&#8217;s, waiting out the brunt of the storm.</p>

<p>And now I&#8217;m at work, 15 hours later, looking over a list of 20-ish items assigned to Team Intern. Trouble with seniority and geekishness is that you end up having to handle most of&#8230; whatever. We&#8217;re expected to be able to handle anything, but&#8230; bah, we can&#8217;t even get into the client management system. We&#8217;re <em>interns</em>. There&#8217;s no <em>way</em>&#8230;</p>

<p>Quiet now.</p>

<p>We lost power at the house last night; came on while I was sleeping.</p>

<p>My sobe is warm.</p>

<p>It occurred to me the other day. I want someone to mean the world to me.</p>

<p>I am thinking it&#8217;s a sign<br />
that the freckles in our eyes are mirror images<br />
and when we kiss they&#8217;re perfectly aligned<br />
and I have to speculate<br />
that God himself did make<br />
us into corresponding shapes<br />
like puzzle pieces from the clay</p>
<p>and true, it may seem like a stretch<br />
but its thoughts like this that catch<br />
my troubled head when you&#8217;re away<br />
when I am missing you to death<br />
when you are out there on the road<br />
for several weeks of shows<br />
and when you scan the radio<br />
I hope this song will guide you home</p>
<p><em>they will see us waving from such great heights,</em><br />
<em>&#8220;come down now&#8221;, they&#8217;ll say</em><br />
<em>but everything looks perfect from far away,</em><br />
<em>&#8220;come down now&#8221;, but we&#8217;ll stay&#8230;</em></p>
<p>I tried my best to leave<br />
this all on your machine<br />
but the persistent beat it sounded thin<br />
upon listening<br />
and that frankly will not fly<br />
you will hear the shrillest highs<br />
and lowest lows with the windows down<br />
when this is guiding you home</p>
<p><em>they will see us waving from such great heights,</em><br />
<em>&#8220;come down now&#8221;, they&#8217;ll say</em><br />

<p>It&#8217;s been raining on and off the last few days. The kind of weather that keeps me from concentrating at all unless I&#8217;m on a highway somewhere.</p>

<p>Tried to musick on the way home. Heh, failed. Not completely sure why &#8211; it was missing. &#8216;Missing&#8217; in the context of action, like a projectile. Like throwing something and missing the target &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t hitting right.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid of the media player&#8217;s odd progress bar movement. Textpattern changed up some things with the upgrade that affect data transfer for downloads; I&#8217;m switching this player out for a different one soon anyway.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m at the office. The <span class=""caps"">CFO</span> brought in his kids (ages 1-6, I think) for lunch; he&#8217;s showing them the shredder. The kids were freaking out, but they&#8217;re getting better. &#8220;&#8230; Buh why you do dah doh?&#8221;</p>

<p>A woman called in the other morning, said someone called her house at six a.m., said &#8220;screw you&#8221;, hung up. Which is odd, as I can&#8217;t think of anyone on our team who would do such a thing. Sober, anyway. I looked her up; turns out that the woman in question had just done a mini-seminar for senior citizens in California on protecting yourself from financial predators. Oh, the irony.</p>

Now eat your salad.&#8221;</p>

<p>The album plays like a reality show (assuming that you listen to your mother and go in track order). The husband crashes through the front door, raging about the office. Screaming about the state of things. Blinks, then is calm. Deep breath. Apologizes, gives her a kiss, and retires.</p>

<p>Never having heard any of <span class=""caps"">NIN</span>&#8217;s work, the first track left me slightly taken aback. Which is understandable, coming as I do from the influences of Linkin Park, the Benedictine Monks of Santo Domingo de Silos and Hilary Duff combined. It&#8217;s gabber, essentially, but with more subtle undertones than what you&#8217;d hear at <a href=""http://di.fm"">di.fm</a>.</p>

<p>And vocals. I&#8217;m not a fan of the vocals. By and large. When the guy&#8217;s melodic (e.g. The Great Destroyer), it&#8217;s not bad. When he goes monotone, it makes children cry.</p>

<p>I downloaded it, yeah; still deciding whether or not to buy the thing&#8230; It was sitting in my Amazon cart from earlier (sign up for our Visa card, get $30 off!). Might just get a few songs.</p>

2007-07-19 18:18:20,Txp: Creating Custom RSS Feeds,"<img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/552.jpg"" alt="""" />

All other factors aside, Wordpress still has one up on Textpattern for custom <span class=""caps"">RSS</span> feeds – a function with quite a lot of potential. Textpattern doesn’t technically offer this capability, but it’s fairly simple to construct an alternative.

<strong>Step the First: Page/Section</strong>
Open up the Textpattern control panel and scoot over to the Pages area (under Presentation). Create a new page (or copy an existing page); save it as <code>myrss</code> or something clever.

Open up the Sections tab. Create a new section with the same name as your new-and-shiny page. After creating the section, find it in the section list and change the “Uses page” field to <code>myrss</code>. Twiddle with the other settings if you’re terribly bored; we won’t be needing them for anything.

<strong>Step the Second: Constructing the Feed</strong>
Back to Pages. Open up the <code>myrss</code> page. Delete everything in it, then copy in the following:
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;rss version=""2.0"" xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""
xmlns:content=""http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/""&gt;
&lt;channel&gt;
&lt;generator&gt;http://textpattern.com/&lt;/generator&gt;
&lt;title&gt;&lt;txp:sitename /&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link&gt;&lt;txp:link_to_home /&gt;&lt;/link&gt;
&lt;pubDate&gt;&lt;txp:php&gt;echo strftime( ""%a, %d %b %G %T %Z"" );&lt;/txp:php&gt;&lt;/pubDate&gt;
&lt;txp:article_custom allowoverride=""0"" form=""myrss"" limit=""5"" pgonly=""0"" section=""blog"" /&gt;
&lt;/channel&gt;
&lt;/rss&gt;
</code></pre>
(<strong>Note:</strong> change the <code>section</code> attribute of <code>txp:article_custom</code> to whatever section you want to be pulling articles from. Also – the presence of the <span class=""caps"">PHP</span> bit means that <span class=""caps"">PHP</span> parsing must be enabled for this to work properly. You can set this in Admin -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Publish -&gt; “Allow <span class=""caps"">PHP</span> in pages?”.)

Save this, then move to the Forms tab.

<strong>Step the Third: Custom <span class=""caps"">RSS</span> Items</strong>
Open up a blank form (“Create new form”), then paste in the following:
<pre><code>&lt;item&gt;
&lt;title&gt;&lt;txp:title /&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;description&gt;
&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;txp:body /&gt;
]]&gt;
&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;link&gt;&lt;txp:permlink /&gt;&lt;/link&gt;
&lt;pubDate&gt;&lt;txp:posted format=""%a, %d %b %G %T %Z"" /&gt;&lt;/pubDate&gt;
&lt;dc:creator&gt;&lt;txp:author /&gt;&lt;/dc:creator&gt;
&lt;guid&gt;&lt;txp:permlink /&gt;&lt;/guid&gt;
&lt;/item&gt;
</code></pre>
Name it <code>myrss</code> (or something different; you’ll need to change the page if you go all creative here). Change the form type to “Article” and save it.

<strong>Step the Fourth: Slack-Jawed Admiration</strong>
You’re done, actually. Or nearly. Load up <a href=""http://domain.com/myrss"">domain.com/myrss</a> and gaze in wonder.

Now take a step back. You’re here to trick out your feed, and thus far we’ve only created the framework. At this point, you can go back to the <code>myrss</code> article form and have your way with it – anything you put in into the <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> area will be used in the feed at /myrss (check my feed for an example). Article images are a common addition, but anything that Textpattern can do, your feed can use.

(<strong>Note:</strong> Don’t mess with anything other than <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> unless you know what you’re doing, btw. Feeds break easily.)

<strong>Epilogue: The Problem</strong>
<del>The only issue with this technique is the content headers. A <a href=""http://feedvalidator.org/"">feed validator</a> will tell you that it’s being served as <code>text/html</code>, and that this is bad. In theory, tacking <code>&lt;txp:php&gt;header( ""Content-type: text/xml"", true);&lt;/txp:php&gt;</code> on to the beginning of the <code>myrss</code> page would fix this, but it doesn’t seem to have an effect. If anyone has any brilliant ideas, leave a note and I’ll add it/them to this article.</del>

<a href=""http://www.michaelgravel.com/"">Mike</a> has a plugin available that’ll take care of this – download it <a href=""http://www.dev.michaelgravel.com/text/plugin-mg_setheader"">here</a>. (Thanks, Mike)

<del>In the meantime</del> As an alternative, running the feed through <a href=""http://feedburner.com"">Feedburner</a> will solve your problems (and add even more functionality, actually).

Go in customized-Textpattern-rss peace.

(Clarification &#8211; &#8216;life&#8217;, not the people in it.) Just went through a slew of old&#8230; things&#8230; papers and cards and CDs from the last 18 years. If all of my untouched-for-more-than-a-month possessions were just burned, I really don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d have a problem with it. Might actually be for the best, as I have a terrible time every time I remember something that used to be important. Letters from the girl, cards from grandma, a CD with that rotating 3D lighthouse model that I wrote in raw <a href=""http://povray.org/""><span class=""caps"">POV</span>-Ray</a> script in sixth grade&#8230; Gah.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a print of a conversation with Anthony, an old Best Buy gift card that I should probably check the balance on before it gets tossed. Copy of Rainman from someone at work. Stack of Glyph Solutions business cards, email addresses from everyone in my cabin at Fort five years ago. This is interesting &#8211; a dual session CD that has the sound effects for a puppet show script from&#8230; idk, something for the kids at church. The data session has the runtime engine for <a href=""http://www.enterbrain.co.jp/tkool/RPG_XP/eng/""><span class=""caps"">RPG</span> Maker</a>.</p>

<p>These are recent. Copies from the English Language AP test. Synthesize six sources and write an essay on the effects of advertising. Analyze the strategies used by Scott Russell Sanders to develop his perspective on moving. Develop a position on the ethics of offering incentives for charitable acts. &#8230; Can&#8217;t believe I pwned that test the way I did.</p>

<p>sigh</p>

<p>Memories suck. Even good ones. I hate remembering things that aren&#8217;t anymore. Old friendships, old enemies, old loves. There&#8217;s always something coming on that&#8217;ll shove them out of their place and into the corner. I forget so many things, and that&#8217;s probably for the best. Though it just makes it difficult when I find things that bring them back.</p>

<p><em>in cards and flowers on the window</em><br />
<em>your friends all plead for you to stay</em></p>

<p>I was thinking the other night, looking at whoever that is on the other side of the mirror. All I really want is to sleep, and sleep without dreaming. Complete lack of any brain activity. This isn&#8217;t anything new; it&#8217;s why I take sleeping pills on occasion. What struck me was the thought process that followed as I wondered if I wanted to wake up.</p>

<p>Do I want to wake up? Would it be so terrible to just fall asleep and never have to get up again? There would be nothing to regret, nothing to miss. Just dark and nothing.</p>

<p>Well, okay. What about sleeping for, say, a week. Would you miss a week of your life? Probably not.</p>

<p>Right, okay. You wouldn&#8217;t miss a week of your life. This tells me that you&#8217;re not particularly attached to the day-by-day nature of&#8230; life. The little idiosyncrasies of existence.</p>

<p>Not terribly.</p>

<p>What about a year? What if you cut out a year?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not like I remember much of last year. Live in the present and for the future.</p>

<p>A year&#8217;s a fairly big chunk of time.</p>

<p>Time is relative.</p>

<p>A week, a year, okay. What&#8217;s to stop you from scaling that to, say, the rest of your life? Would you miss the rest of your life?</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>At this point, the little conversation in my head stopped abruptly.</p>

2007-07-24 05:25:49,compendium,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/563.jpg"" /></p>	<p>Saw Transformers again, and realized, as I started to get emotional for no particular reason, that I (deja vu) really seem to be able to feel only when I am flooded with sound. Completely overrun with audio.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been writing random little notes in Textpattern for the last few weeks; just going to throw them all in now. Excuse me.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>Just took receipt of a nondescript grey plastic mailer with a Royal Mail shipping label adhered to the corner. There&#8217;s a custom&#8217;s mark on it, says &#8220;clothes&#8221;. It&#8217;s been sent through air mail.</p>

<p>This makes me nervous. Remember the <a href=""ihttp://ikebowen.com/2007/07/02/untitled-695"">eBay/Prada situation</a>? One of the sellers involved mysteriously left me positive feedback&#8230; Though I paid her nothing, so I don&#8217;t see why she&#8217;d actually ship the <a href=""http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#38;item=160130440644"">Womens Prada T-Shirt <span class=""caps"">BNWT</span> in Black Sizes S &#38; M <span class=""caps"">NEW</span>!!</a> in question.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>Things the little designer inside of me formed a bond with upon seeing:</p>

<p><a href=""http://store.artlebedev.com/catalog/computer_add-ons/sonicum/"">Sonicum</a><br />
(right, so this one is jointly desired by designer and audiophile)</p>

(beauty. in a clock.)</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#62; /me nudges Isaac<br />
&#62; dude.  I just gotta say.  You&#8217;re an awesome friend, I just wanted to say thanks.<br />
&#62; I dont know where that came from</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That more or less just made my life&#8230; not sure if the guy on the other end knew it. No one has ever said that to me, straight out of the blue, without sounding like they&#8217;re just returning a complement. I&#8217;ve had girls tell me I&#8217;d make a great boyfriend, but not for them, and far too many others just say &#8216;we should hang out sometime&#8217; and never call.</p>

<p>sigh</p>

<p>Ah well. My (former) therapist would take this opportunity to say I have some sort of inferiority complex. I would say he&#8217;s wrong.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>I dreamed of flying last night.</p>

<p>I was with others on a boat, I think. Landed on an island. I saw two small buildings, and in one of them was a small, golden falcon. He was left alone on the island, and needed someone to go with. He showed me how. We pushed the clouds away and followed the wind.</p>

<p>Last night left me shaken. I&#8217;m not sure why; there was nothing that would have warranted such a response. I simply felt unsure, and pressured, as if there was a decision to be made quickly. (About God, I think.)</p>

<p><em>shred your lungs, I need to hear you louder now</em></p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>We went to the fair. More crowd-watching than anything. Struck me how all the entertainment and emotional high is crammed in to one spot. Everywhere else is just bland &#8211; here is where the good times are.</p>

<p>Or something like that.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve unexpectedly come across the photo of my second grade class. The teacher was cool.</p>

<p>Oh&#8230; you just found a boyfriend. Haven&#8217;t heard from you in years. You&#8217;re normal. You&#8217;re dead. Don&#8217;t remember you. I think you dropped out. Haven&#8217;t seen you since&#8230; sophomore year. Normal. Unknown. Most-likely-to-have-an-abusive-boyfriend. Unknown. Unknown. Unknown. Normal. Me. Fairly normal. Anger disorder? Consistently high.</p>

<p>bleh</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>That grey nondescript mailer from England? Yeah, they were *NEW* <span class=""caps"">MENS</span> <span class=""caps"">PRADA</span> <span class=""caps"">BLACK</span> <span class=""caps"">SHORTS</span> <span class=""caps"">BNWT</span> SZ:34&#8221; NO <span class=""caps"">RESERVE</span>!!. The fellow thanked me for my honesty and asked me to mail them back. Question is, will he pay shipping?</p>

<p>Not that this has anything to do with anything, but I just pushed release 2 of Workplace Confessional to the internets. Or not just, I guess, more like last week. Saturday. Or something.</p>

<p>Anyway, yeah, check it out &#8211; <a href=""http://workplaceconfessional.com"">workplaceconfessional.com</a>. As far as I know, it&#8217;s one of the only <span class=""caps"">AJAX</span> Textpattern sites. Integration with <a href=""http://clean-ajax.sourceforge.net"">Clean <span class=""caps"">AJAX</span></a> wasn&#8217;t hard, actually; that particular library is very barebones (but functional), making it simple to mod and implement.</p>

<p>In other news, I have three weeks left in this town. At the max; not sure what my plans are. Move in at <span class=""caps"">IIT</span> is the 19th, so I suppose it isn&#8217;t even three at this point. I swore at the beginning of the summer to take a few weeks off of work at the end of summer and visit family. Looks like that fell through.</p>

<p>In my defense, that was before I realized that my employer was going independent. Bah. It&#8217;s been a good move, of course, but it&#8217;s meant 50hr weeks all summer.</p>

<p><em>cause tonight will be the last night that you ever see, my pretty eyes<br />

Which is a shame. I feel like I should say something about potential wasted here, but I can’t think of anything along those lines.

So I’ll just talk about what I think I know, which I try to go for anyway.

But hearing people mumble quickly through words memorized in first grade at the local Catholic school, or make a list of problems verbally addressed to some deity&#8230; it&#8217;s absolutely ridiculous.</p>

<p>And maybe I&#8217;m just sensitive to that because of my beliefs and the way I was brought up. But honestly. If you make an attempt at prayer, remember who you&#8217;re freaking addressing.

<p>Couple things.</p>
<p>First, the CDs expected in the mail did not come today. I can&#8217;t tell you how disappointed I was to, instead, find only a mailing from the Navy. No, I do not want a free beaner and information from a local recruiter.</p>
<p>Secondly, <a href=""http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#38;item=230154109490"">New Arizona Men&#8217;s Sneaker Fit Low Rise 32&#215;32 Vintage</a>. These were meant to be mine, they were. I&#8217;ve used the Unwired Buyer service in the past &#8211; very handy &#8211; but apparently they decided not to call me in time this round.</p>
<p>Third, and this ties in with the second, the power went out today. For a twenty minute rainstorm, apparently there was a decent amount of damage. I&#8217;ve just gotten home from dinner (Dad: &#8220;It&#8217;s time for our annual The-Power-Is-Out,-Shall-We-Have-Dinner-In-Town? outing.&#8221;), signed on to ebay, and voila! &#8211; 41 seconds left on the auction for those blasted pants.

<p>The above was written last night at roughly 10:30, when I actually did have some intent of going to sleep. Nah. Besides, if I had, I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to get through <a href=""http://www.rhapsody.com/eddieizzard/dresstokill"">the entire standup album</a>.</p>

<p>First to go was most of the horizon, then the shrubbery kind of thing off to the side. Also some miscellaneous clutter on the ground.</p>

<p>The photo itself ended up looking like <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/images/565.jpg"">this</a>, but it felt like it needed something else to be done. When in doubt, try a <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/images/566.jpg"">grungy filmstrip overlay</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a while. Heh, the Blogger&#8217;s Lethargy has set in.</p>

<p><em>i lie here paralytic / inside this soul / screaming for you till my throat is numb / i wanna break out i need a way out / i don&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s gotta be this way / the worst is the waiting / in this womb i&#8217;m suffocating</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;m taking this week off from work. You wouldn&#8217;t &#8211; nah, you actually probably would &#8211; believe how nice this is. And while &#8220;nice&#8221; is a generally overrated descriptor, it&#8217;s really the only way to describe six days in a row in which one is not working until seven.</p>

<p>Also, I&#8217;ve discovered that a double dosage of sleeping aids will last roughly twelve hours.</p>

<p><em>feel your presence filling up my lungs with oxygen / i take you in / i&#8217;ve died</em></p>

<p>In line with spending rediculous (yes, I know it&#8217;s spelled incorrectly&#8230; &#8216;ridiculous&#8217; looks, erm, rediculous) amounts of cash in prep for school (shoes, <a href=""http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#38;item=280142360658"">pants</a>... walmart&#8230;), I&#8217;ve picked up two shirts from Threadless &#8211; <a href=""http://www.threadless.com/product/826/The_Leftover"">The Leftover</a> and <a href=""http://www.threadless.com/product/59/Bleeding_Heart"">Bleeding Heart</a>. Should be coming in tomorrow.</p>

<p><em>rebirthing now / i wanna live for love wanna live for you and me / breathe for the first time now / i come alive somehow / rebirthing now / i wanna live my life wanna give you everything / breathe for the first time now / i come alive somehow</em></p>

<p>Though now that I think about it, those should be in before departure. In an attempt to fulfill the annual vow to see more my extended family, I&#8217;ll be in the Green Bay area tomorrow and the next day. Provided the Intrepid (blasted thing) holds out that far.</p>

<p><em>i lie here lifeless / in this cocoon / shedding my skin cause / i&#8217;m ready to / i wanna break out / i found a way out / i don&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s gotta be this way / the worst is the waiting / in this womb i&#8217;m suffocating</em></p>

<p>I actually just got the death certificate for it today. Or, well, perhaps not &#8216;death certificate&#8217;&#8230; more like a &#8216;well-yeah-your-cars-gonna-call-it-quits-soon-pay-us certificate&#8217;. Northwoods Auto. Apparently the front right transaxle (learned a new word today) is having fits, and with increasing frequency. There&#8217;s a solution, yes, but given that the solution would set me back $1500, it&#8217;s not likely to be implemented anytime soon. Pah.</p>

<p><em>tell me when i&#8217;m gonna live again / tell me when i&#8217;m gonna breathe you in / tell me when i&#8217;m gonna feel inside / tell me when i&#8217;m gonna feel alive</p>

<p>tell me when i&#8217;m gonna live again / tell me when this fear will end / tell me when i&#8217;m gonna feel inside / tell me when i&#8217;ll feel alive</em></p>

<p>The song I&#8217;ve posted here is from Comatose &#8211; latest offering from Skillet. I think I ran into it pretty randomly last night, wandering the internets. This and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgiJkrAL9K4"">Whispers in the Dark</a> are friggen excellent. Watch the video &#8211; the mov version, if your internets are up to it. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve found songs like this, musick that can be felt straight down to your core. Suppose the last time was Minutes to Midnight. Linkin Park and Skillet. Heh. What a juxtaposition.</p>

<p><em>rebirthing now / i wanna live for love wanna live for you and me / breathe for the first time now / i come alive somehow / rebirthing now / i wanna live my life wanna give you everything / breathe for the first time now / i come alive somehow</em></p>

<p>I should probably note that the person at the drums is not a dude with copious amounts of hair, but is in fact female. Ha. Guess I didn&#8217;t need to point that out, but it&#8217;s kinda neat to see perfect gender parity in a band like this. Doesn&#8217;t happen terribly often.</p>

It was the sun playing through the screen on one of the basement windows, arriving at the furnace and stopping as if suddenly unsure of its bearings. Sunlight gets confused, too.</p>

<p>This would be a great lead-in if I had spent the last few days confused and dazed at the overwhelming prospect of <em>college</em>.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t. I&#8217;m sorry. And if you would rather read about something like that, <a href=""http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?q=college+confusion"">go ahead</a>.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s almost nine, Saturday night. I&#8217;m in the basement. The last suitcase is out in front of me, button-down shirts off to the left on the concrete. Someone just turned on the light, threw a paper airplane down the stairs, and left.</p>

<p>Apparently it was Aaron, wishing me goodnight via projectile.</p>

<p>Man. This is starting to get a little weird. Not a lot weird, just a little. This moving out thing. Only because I&#8217;m going to a place I&#8217;ve never been long-term to live with someone I&#8217;ve never seen in person, paying fees I&#8217;ll not see the end of until I&#8217;m fifty.</p>

<p>Still, I feel slightly better knowing exactly how many coffee houses there are there. That number is 429, and it&#8217;s now my avowed goal to visit them all while I&#8217;m there. All of them.</p>

<p>Right, I feel like I should close this last entry from here at home with something profound. Or at least clever. Something.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re all moved in now. Clothes unpacked, bookshelf filled. Equipment set up. Nice to be using a dual monitor array again. ;)</p>

<p>My roommate&#8217;s name is Max. Clinkingbeard. Nice guy. Classical music, which means we shouldn&#8217;t have any problems with late-night partying. Hopefully. Though he was invited to north Chicago by someone who allegedly knows him.</p>

<p>Regardless, the move was smooth. Fairly simple. Only surprise is that I&#8217;m in the standard dorms rather than <span class=""caps"">SSV</span> (or the penthouse, depending on which guard you talk to). Apparently there&#8217;s a 60-student waiting list to get in there, and there already people living in the lounges.</p>

<p>But what have you. It&#8217;ll be fine. &#8230; Slightly cramped (not bad, though), but fine.</p>

<p>They showed Blades of Glory in the auditorium this evening. Way to loosen up the freshmen with a film featuring&#8230; well. Heh. I think it was supposed to be outdoors, but the weather got in the way. Not that it matters much. I love this. 65, overcast, raining. Going to grab my transit pass tomorrow morning after an advisory meeting and visit Ikea. I, uh, need a vertical file&#8230; :) Such a great store.</p>

<p>Anyway. Parents are still in the city somewhere, going to visit the german consulate tomorrow. Get travel things out of the way.</p>

<p>Oh. My laptop died again. And by my hand. :) Remember the issues with <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/2007/07/08/adventures-with-an-a200-vista-and-ubuntu"">removing Ubuntu?</a> Happened again, regrettably. And apparently the Vista recovery tools on the boot disk are hidden behind a window prompting the user for a language and keyboard layout for installation.</p>

2007-08-26 04:11:12,end-of-week,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/607.jpg"" /></p>	<p>Before we begin, let me make this absolutely clear. Bacci Pizzaria closes at four on Saturdays. Any trip made there after such time is made in futility.</p>

<p>And with that said, welcome back.</p>

<p>I feel like I should follow that with something fantastic, but I don&#8217;t have much. Except that the campus is starting to feel comfortable, which usually doesn&#8217;t happen for a good two weeks. It&#8217;s a nice surprise. I&#8217;ve got a job, which is good. Global Grounds CafÃ©, allegedly the only student-run service on campus. I would contest that with the argument that alumni don&#8217;t really count, but vatevah. It&#8217;s a job, and I like coffee. And the people who work there. Which works out.</p>

<p>Whoever ran the scheduling managed to get in more than ten hours each for all initiates (like&#8230; nine of them/us). I assume that makes everyone else&#8217;s schedule as convoluted as mine &#8211; calc II, tech comm, adv intro to programming (yes, there is an advanced intro) and intro to the profession, with coffee-hours dribbled in here and there.</p>

<p>Intro to the profession hasn&#8217;t happened yet, now that you mention it. Twas scheduled for friday, but apparently was canceled last time (no, I didn&#8217;t get the email, thank you) to make room for TGiitF.</p>

<p>Thank God <span class=""caps"">IIT</span>&#8217;s Friday (HA! <span class=""caps"">PUN</span>! &#8230;) seems to be Student Affair&#8217;s way of instilling incoming first-year students with ambition and inspiration. And a yearning desire to find the leader in all of us. *cough</p>

<p>That aside, though. The Pizzaria. They reportedly sell huge pieces of pizza with free sodas for a minimum, and it was my goal to be there for dinner this afternoon.</p>

<p>As long as we were set about accomplishing this, Max and I stopped at Target (concluded that all you really need in life is tweezers, coffee, sticky-tac and the internet), grabbed coffee at Starbucks (doesn&#8217;t count for the Coffee Tour, I know; more about that later), were forced to throw away the Starbucks (no food/drink, say the security guards) <em>and</em> were rejected for library patronage (no proof of in-state residence) at the Chicago Public Library before arriving at Bacci&#8217;s and finding it closed.</p>

<p>Though hear this: I have <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/images/613.jpg"">photo evidence</a> that we did indeed make it there. Ha.</p>

<p><strong>afterthought</strong><br />
More photos to <a href=""/photog"">photog</a>. Today&#8217;s issue includes a subway musician and <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/photog/612"">an alternative view of civilization</a>.</p>

<p>We watched The Fountain tonight. Hugh Jackman, if that makes any difference. I wonder if his role in The Prestige had anything to do with it. They were more similar than I expected.</p>

<p>As was the film to Pan&#8217;s Labrynth, actually (which has no connection whatsoever to Hugh Jackman as far as I&#8217;m aware). Both evoke&#8230; a very raw sort of emotional pain. Deep-rooted, way down at the core where you know the world is completely broken and there&#8217;s nothing you can humanly do to change that. The feeling that comes when you watch your heroes die (<code>/me bows to Ronnie Day</code>) and you watch her walk away for the last time.</p>

<p>But you know how that goes.</p>

<p>Both leave the viewer (who, by that time, either feels like they did when they knew King Kong was going to be shot down or is entirely void of any emotional capacity) with a sensation of having missed. I&#8217;ve talked about this before, and while I&#8217;m not motivated enough atm to look up that particular discussion, it&#8217;s like&#8230; being able to see what <em>could</em> happen, then coming so close to achieving it you <em>know</em> you&#8217;ll succeed, and then seeing yourself, from a distance, fall completely and hopelessly short.</p>

<p>But you know how that goes.</p>

<p>The film&#8217;s score ends with the song I posted above. Together, we will live forever. How do you feel about that? About the idea of death as an act of creation? Death was his road to awe.</p>

<p><code>end quotes;</code></p>

<p>Anyway. I couldn&#8217;t really let that mood go, so&#8230; on to more music. Feelings created by the film as a whole, and set firmly in place with the soundtrack&#8230; yeah. If you&#8217;re specially and particularly bored, look up the song &#8216;eppur si muove&#8217; by Enigma. There are two Enigmas out there, I think, and there are also two songs bearing the aforementioned title. Good luck. Listen to the track up above first &#8211; if you find an Eppur Si Muove that doesn&#8217;t shock you after hearing both in succession, you&#8217;ve found the right one.</p>

<p>Cheers &#8211; </p>

<p><strong>addendum</strong><br />
I wrote a song called that, a long time ago. Stay with me, I love you. Few lyrics, it was all about musickal ambience. Heh. Back in the winsome days of&#8230; last year. Do you ever lose the feeling that you&#8217;ve never really grown up, or that maturity&#8217;s definition always expands beyond you?</p>

<p><strong>The Problem With Videora</strong><br />
Situation: I&#8217;ve come into possession of the entire works of Monty Python &#38; Co. This pleases me, and will suffice until I can afford the huge boxed set.</p>

<p>The Zune desktop software won&#8217;t natively handle avi files (which is silly), so I&#8217;m using the <a href=""http://www.videora.com/en-us/Converter/iPod/"">Videora iPod Converter</a>. This used to be a great freeware video recoder, but has suffered somewhat for the addition of talking advertisements offering two free iPhones.</p>

<p>Additionally, it would appear that not a lot of intensive testing has gone into the application. I discovered this after converting a season&#8217;s worth of Flying Circus episodes, prepending each episode name with &#8220;MP: &#8220;. This was a mistake. The <span class=""caps"">NTFS</span> filesystem&#8217;s name scheme doesn&#8217;t allow colons anywhere. Videora, apparently, doesn&#8217;t know that.</p>

<p>Nor does iTunes. Videora by default adds all converted videos to the iTunes library.</p>

<p>The upshot of all this is that I have two gigs of Monty Python that I can see in iTunes, but not anywhere else. iTunes reports the full filename and path, but it&#8217;s not visible in Windows Explorer or even at the command prompt level (<code>dir</code> etc). Explorer reports the size of the containing folder without taking into account these missing files. I can&#8217;t even see them when I use a Linux bootdisk. Which makes sense, I suppose.</p>

<p>There is one anomalous file, however, that appeared after the conversion batch. It&#8217;s called &#8220;MP&#8221;, no extension, and has a size of exactly 0 bytes. I&#8217;m deleting it.</p>

<p>And suddenly iTunes can&#8217;t find the videos. Looking at the hard drive properties, deleting the file does nothing to the available disk space, but suddenly iTunes can&#8217;t find 2gigs of video.</p>

<p>What on earth.</p>

Scrabble is addictive. So is Facebook. Ergo, <a href=""http://apps.facebook.com/scrabulous/"">Scrabulous</a>. Like how time is an illusion, lunchtime doubly so (10 points to whoever gets that reference).</p>

<p>Between that, and getting up for a seven ay em shift at the coffee shop (apparently no one told me that said shift was unnecessary as of Wednesday), I&#8217;m on a good&#8230; four hours? of sleep. But it was all worth it. <a href=""http://apps.facebook.com/scrabulous/?action=viewboard&#38;gid=1424811"">EXULTeD</a> &#8211; 96 points. Pwned.</p>

2007-09-10 00:26:50,(untitled),"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/614.jpg"" /></p>	<p>Right, that was three hours of doing more or less absolutely nothing. Not bad.</p>

<p>Bit of trivia #&lt;?=rand(0,99)?&gt;: Sobe Adrenaline is cheaper in Madison than Chicago. Along with gas. But the hypnotists are better.</p>

<p>Now that I think of it, this should probably be called &#8216;Adventures in Public Transit&#8217;, rather than whatever it&#8217;s titled.</p>

<p>But that aside. I showed up at the Cumberland Greyhound station at 7:30 Saturday morning, as per instructions on the ticket. Be at the stop no later than one hour before scheduled departure. &#8230; I now know that to be a nasty trick. The Cumberland station doesn&#8217;t even open until eight, and the buses are late anyway.</p>

<p>Hour and a half to Chicago, which isn&#8217;t bad. Though, along with the Cumberland Scheme, I think Greyhound plants at least one middle-age-or-older rambling male on each bus. I got to sit next to one. He was older, but a reasonably nice fellow. He just felt the need to talk about his life to this random youngster that took the seat next to him. Also to cough up stuff into a conveniently placed (but otherwise ordinary) grocery bag. His parting comments went something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My father, you know, he had his 59th anniversary in November. I&#8217;m from Madison, originally. Well, a long time ago. He died the next day. I went up there, missed the funeral by three hours. And well, it was too cold for this body, I went to the hospital for two weeks.</p>
<p>Then I went back to Texas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A nice guy. But&#8230; heh. Yeah.</p>

<p>That aside, Matthew picked me up at the Milwaukee station upon arrival. And off to the bustling, modern, under-construction UW-Madison campus to see Ben and the rest.</p>

<p>There was this Italian restaurant on State Street (State Street, Goldsworthy!). Za&#8217;s, I think? There were no waiters in suits &#8211; guests filled out <em>scantron</em> forms, handed them to the cashier, and waited for the order to be filled. Really incredibly efficient; can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve never seen that done before.</p>

<p>And shopping and such. I won&#8217;t bore you with details. Though Ben shared the wisdom of the UW Badger Buddy political-correctness-thinger, which included this on the subject of &#8220;fags&#8221;. Parental warning, and I&#8217;m sorry that I&#8217;m even including this (which is a lie, yes), but it&#8217;s hilarious&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Fag&#8221; &#8211; do not say this. It is offensive to homosexuals, though its contemporary meaning has evolved from its original usage. In medieval times, a &#8220;fag&#8221; referred to a group of homosexuals tied together, &#8220;bundled&#8221;, and lit on fire for the sole purpose of lighting an unrelated convicted person at the stake, as one might use kindling.</p>
<p>Thus, one might have used the word as follows: &#8220;Hast thou lit the fag?&#8221; &#8220;Nearly &#8211; mine peon hast not yet lashed it tightly.&#8221; &#8220;Hasten thee, the execution is already late!&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Needless to say, this is horribly, horribly wrong&#8230; I&#8217;ve paraphrased (heh), but that was the gist of it. Again, apologies for including that.</p>

<p>Anyway. Anyway anyway.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.frederickwinters.com/"">Frederick Winters</a> served as entertainment for the evening, reportedly as America&#8217;s leading hypnotist. And he <em>was</em> good. One of the fraternities on campus brought in a hypnotist during rush week, but Winters put that act to shame by taking the spotlight off himself and putting it onto his (utterly clueless&#8230; heh) volunteers. Rather than clearly defining a situation (&#8220;You are a dog. *snigger&#8221;), he gave the subjects a loose set of boundaries and let their imaginations fill in the gaps.</p>

<p>Which was <em>cool</em>. There is no sight quite like a hypnotized woman taking the microphone away from the hypnotist, then beat-boxing so her poodle Fifi (who was a guy, yes) could break-dance.</p>

<p>Favorite line came from one of four guys who sang an dramatic operatic rendition of Happy Birthday to someone from the crowd.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hypnotist: Wow, and how long have you been singing opera?<br />
Guy: Oh, ha, 80 years.<br />
Hypnotist: And how old are you?<br />
Guy (without hesitation): Thirteen!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The trip back was less eventful. Or perhaps not, I guess. Bus stations have some interesting people in them. A black guy, for example, with three kids. Who needed change for a phone call and money for bus fare. His story: the courts had just awarded him custody for his kids after his ex-wife had been incarcerated for crack cocaine use, and he now apparently had to go somewhere. One of the kids threw up shortly after the story.</p>

<p>And another fellow (black again&#8230; blasted racial stereotypes) asked me for a phone so he could call someone. And yeah, I let him. One, there were plenty of people in the station &#8211; he couldn&#8217;t pull anything. I think. Two, he didn&#8217;t look dangerous. Not a trustworthy conclusion, I know, but still. Three, I was taller. It helps.</p>

<p>He called his grandmother. Asked her if she was making dinner. <em>What</em> she was making for dinner, and if there would be enough for him. And, by the way, would it be alright if he stayed for three days or so.</p>

<p>sigh</p>

<p>Anyway. Sum point of the trip: I now have sunglasses. And it was great to see Matt/Ben again.</p>

<p>Couple random things:</p>

<p><strong>Maple 11 for 50% off</strong><br />
Students can use the promotional code &#8220;MP000072&#8221; at <a href=""http://maplesoft.com"">MapleSoft</a> to get Maple 11 (legally &#8211; woot) for $50, down from the usual student price of $99. This is good. And also much cheaper than the $1825 charged for the commercial release.</p>

<p><strong>Superhero</strong><br />
Few people are aware, but my left leg was once part of the Fantastic Four.</p>

<p><strong>New Discounts for MagazineLine Customers</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve just gotten an email from MagazineLine (purchased a subscription to Wired from them last month). Apparently there&#8217;s some sort of sale. On Discovery <span class=""caps"">KIDS</span> and Playboy, and in that order.</p>

<p><strong>Six Seventeen</strong><br />
Now it&#8217;s approaching the evening. I can work with this.</p>

<p><em>Where are we?<br />
What the hell is going on?<br />
The dust has only just began to fall</em></p>

<p>It normally doesn&#8217;t take two hours to run to Target and back, but it helps if you board the wrong train and then backtrack in consequence.</p>

<p><em>Spin me around again<br />
And rub my eyes<br />
This can&#8217;t be happening<br />
When busy streets<br />
Amess with people<br />
Would stop to hold<br />
Their heads heavy</em></p>

<p>I took the wrong train. Kinda glad I did, though not for any particularly special reason. It just meant that I had to wait and be quiet for a few unexpected minutes of the day. The train I boarded was packed, standing room only for businessmen and women at the end of their day. It was silent. No idle conversation, not even someone on a phone call. Just wheels on uneven tracks, moving over cars on an overpass, driven by people oblivious to another point of view.</p>

<p><em>Hide and seek<br />
Trains and sewing machines<br />
All those years<br />
They were here first</em></p>

<p>&#8216;Halstead. Doors open on the left at Halstead. Doors closing.&#8217;</p>

<p><em>Oily marks appear on walls<br />
Where pleasure moments hung before<br />
The takeover<br />
The sweeping insensitivity of this still life</em></p>

<p>And I waited there, the only one on a white concrete island. Just waited. The sun was at that spot that makes it impossible to drive comfortably, shining under the visor and above the horizon. And cold wind.</p>

<p><em>Hide and Seek<br />
Trains and sewing machines (you won&#8217;t catch me around here)<br />
Blood and Tears<br />
They were here first</em></p>

<p>There are two environments that I could spend hours just <em>being</em> in, and Chicago&#8217;s had them both in the last couple weeks. Dim, overcast and damp, something to the tune of sixty five degrees. No wind, a little rain. And then what it was today &#8211; sixty two, a cold wind, and an intense evening light.</p>

<p><em>Hmm, what&#8217;d you say, mmm, that you only meant well?<br />
Well, &#8216;course you did<br />
Hmm, what&#8217;d you say, mmm, that it&#8217;s all for the best<br />
Of course it is<br />
Hmm, what&#8217;d you say, mmm, that it&#8217;s just what we need<br />
You decided this<br />
Hmm, what&#8217;d you say, mmm, what did she say?</em></p>

<p>This is a song. Heh. Imogen Heap, playing with a keyboard and some <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-Tune"">Auto-Tune-esque</a> vocoder. Read into that as far as you want, but if shallow&#8217;s all you&#8217;re looking for, it sounds cool.</p>

<p><em>Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth<br />
Mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut-outs<br />
Speak no feeling, no I don&#8217;t believe you<br />

This will probably be painful for you, but at least you can stop reading whenever you feel like it. I <em>wrote</em> this friggen thing.</p>

<p>Biggest news: the third release of <a href=""http://textpattern.org/plugins/789/ike_slideshow"">ike_slideshow</a> (<a href=""http://ikebowen.com/ike_slideshow"">demo demo demo</a>). As per the usual, a new release of the thing took six relatively solid hours of dev work. In my defense (because it really shouldn&#8217;t have taken that long for what I did), Meryss distracted me until roughly 2:30am. Blast you, Meryss.</p>

<p>Heh. Kidding.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m writing this from Calc II Recitation. It seems to be a law, however obscure, that Isaac will not ever go to the right room first if class is held anywhere except its usual location in E1.</p>

<p>Looking at the weather. 72 degrees, which also happens to be the title of track 12 on <a href=""http://www.pandora.com/music/album/venus+hum/the+colors+in+the+wheel"">The Colors in the Wheel</a> &#8211; Venus Hum.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t understand the TA. He&#8217;s Russian, I think, with an accent that jumps up and down in front of your face until you realize that it&#8217;s not <em>quite</em> opaque, and you can see through it if you squint a little.</p>

<p>It was a serious mistake not to get the calc book right away. Have I told that story? I ordered the book in mid August, and when it became obvious that the expedited shipping really wasn&#8217;t doing any good (I realized this last week), the seller issued me a refund for the entire order. Which was nice.</p>

<p>Predictably, the book arrived the next day.</p>

<p>Also predictably, it was the wrong book.</p>

<p>Which brings in the moral dilemma of what really should be <em>done</em> with the thing. I have a refund on my credit card for it, and while the refund on shipping is clear and above board (btw, they wrote the wrong zipcode on the shipping label), refund on the book&#8230; bleh. Should probably go back to the seller. If only because proceeds from the sale go to Africa or something.</p>

<p>Anyway. Moral of the story. Don&#8217;t wait two weeks after realizing you have the wrong book before ordering the <em>correct</em> book. Which I did. And I&#8217;m now thoroughly lost (no thanks to the TA&#8217;s enthusiastic Russian heritage), and have pretty much given tomorrow&#8217;s exam up for lost.</p>

<p>Worse could happen. Which reminds me &#8211; I need to pay my tuition.</p>

<p>*cough</p>

<p>Hello, happy Monday. I&#8217;m here early for calc II, figured I should probably catch up on the last few days. Notably, my textbook for this class is finally in. Here&#8217;s to a better next exam.</p>

<p><strong>Wednesdays</strong><br />
My Wednesdays are terrible, on an unrelated note. Class, ten minutes, class, ten minutes, work, five minutes, class. The work shift is 2.4 hours with an Indian fellow who I&#8217;m sure, despite his accent and apparent inability to think independently, is quite competent. Where his competency lies and how far down it&#8217;s buried, I do not know. Reasonably nice fellow, though.</p>

<p>Speaking of Wednesday. &#8230; I think it was Wednesday. Though not that it matters; forget I said anything. I was late to CS100 at some point last week &#8211; Wednesday, for the sake of argument &#8211; which has become something of a comfortable norm. There&#8217;s not nearly enough time between the end of my shift at the caf&eacute; and the start of lecture to be there sitting down before the professor begins speaking.</p>

<p>A bit of background: I use my laptop at work to play <a href=""http://pandora.com"">Pandora</a>, right. Jack it into the sound system and preach music to the entire building. Methinks I had <a href=""http://pandora.com/stations/2581a8d5ba914842e92ca39c477d6c3dc29045a5cf801fa8"">Top DJs</a> playing that particular day, which was absolutely perfect. Middle-aged Jewish men are known to like house/dance, yes?</p>

<p>But yeah, I left work in a rush, just put the laptop into hibernation and ran to class. Walked in to class late, sat down in the back. Opened the laptop. Which, by the way, has Harman Kardon speakers. Beautiful things, as laptop audio goes.</p>

<p>Not so good when they&#8217;re unexpectedly blaring house music and you can&#8217;t turn it down because Windows is being poky about letting you log in. I don&#8217;t think you can really appreciate this situation unless you&#8217;ve seen a middle-aged Jewish professor give you an appraising look and, hesitantly, ask if you might be able to turn it down a bit.</p>

<p>Heh. So I left the room to try and sort it out. Picture this: some guy walking through the CS building halls, carrying a laptop that&#8217;s doing its level best to raise whatever dead might happen to be nearby.</p>

<p><strong>Homeward</strong><br />
Went back home for the weekend. Left on Friday (which meant maintaining consciousness until three again to finish Friday&#8217;s labwork, also to get the oreo crumbs out of my speakers). Greyhound to Milwaukee, then hitched a ride with Matt &#38; Co. Suffice it to say that it was really very nice to see mi familia again. I&#8217;ve not had any issues with being homesick, but it&#8217;s still good to be back home for a while.</p>

<p>Until I got a voicemail message from work. &#8220;Isaac, where are you? You have a shift &#8211; three to six today.&#8221; And another, from the top manager: &#8220;Isaac, I don&#8217;t know <em>where</em> you are, but the caf&eacute;&#8216;s closed and we&#8217;re losing revenue. Call me back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Long story short, he didn&#8217;t get that strictly right. It wasn&#8217;t closed. People covered it. But&#8230; bah. I wasn&#8217;t aware I had a shift then, for a variety of reasons that are too fantastically dull to explain.</p>

<p>Anyway. I&#8217;m not fired just yet, but that did put a damper on the time I had left at home.</p>

<p>The drive back wasn&#8217;t bad. Music in a car with three agreeable persons. Also a cherry Bawls (since when do they make those?) and a couple <a href=""http://www.nutrisoda.com/index.asp"">nutrisodas</a>. I started to drop the Bawls can a couple times, falling asleep as I was while drinking it. :) Few things to note about that particular drive: there are an alarming number of billboards between Stevens Point and Milwaukee, proclaiming the wonders of hip replacement and resurfacing (call your doctor today), and there&#8217;s a quite genial attendant at the Stevens Point Mobile R-Store. He liked my pen.</p>

<p>And, for the record, I&#8217;m through with Greyhound. No more. My bus was late &#8211; by fifty minutes. It was subsequently full, and I had to wait for the next one. Twenty minutes, also late. Boarded the bus, found a seat behind a collegiate guy with a blonde crewcut who, aside from feeling the need to explain why a school without parties and beer isn&#8217;t really a school, did his level best to stretch his body out on the horizontal plane by pushing the seat in front forwards and pushing his seat backwards. Good to know that there are still a few Americans focused solely on their own comfort. Not many, but still.</p>

<p>The red line train was out of commission last night, making the easiest route home both longer and out-of-the-way.</p>

<p>In bed by twelve thirty. Which isn&#8217;t bad, generally speaking, but was a good three hours later than I had hoped.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
And now the week. Flat fifty percent on my first calc II exam, and it&#8217;s going to be 91 today.</p>

<p>Excuse the extended string of complaints. Could easily be worse.</p>

<p>Hm. I think I want a burger.</p>

<p>I have hope for today.</p>

<p>Roughly 367 other individuals at one point had a similar sentiment, and blogged about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because of heaven I have hope for today and for tomorrow. I am free to live the impossible.&#8221; &#8211; <a href=""http://christianwomenonline.net/labels/Hope.html"">Christian Women Online Blog</a> (that&#8217;s as opposed to a print blog, which is otherwise known as a newspaper column)</p>

<p>&#8220;I have hope for today. I love today. I will love today. I will also dance in my chair in the computer lab, because I don&#8217;t care what anyone thinks.&#8221; &#8211; <a href=""http://raynala.livejournal.com"">what&#8217;s the point in all this screaming?</a></p>

<p>&#8220;7 days sober today, time to do some laundry. No wonder I felt like I was rotting for years. Now I have hope for today.&#8221; &#8211; some alcoholism recovery forum</p>

<p>The following was written on Wednesday, oddly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Life has settled into a discernible pattern. Wake up to Shadow of the Day at 8:30, weekdays. Shower, dress, experiment with hair products. Grab something caffeinated, get to class. Food, work. Waste time. Sleep, and repeat.</p>
<p>Which isn&#8217;t so bad. Or expensive, fortunately, unless a trip to Target or Micro Center is in the mix. I&#8217;ve got the caffeine habit down to one bottle of Bawls daily, but that&#8217;ll probably change. Tomorrow, I think. Not for any particular reason, just that my tolerance fluctuates and it&#8217;s probably time for the headaches to start. ;)</p>
<p>Finally have cable in the dorm, which is what the last trip to MC was about. Picked up a <a href=""http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2825463&#38;CatId=1427""><span class=""caps"">TVB</span>ox 1440</a>, so-called for its ability to handle 1440&#215;900 monitors, which the box touts often (which is silly; all it does is stretch and distort the image). This was the second attempt at bringing the wonders of American broadcasting to the room; the previous trip yielded a usb stick along <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J1CCGA/ref=pd_cp_e_0/104-6190637-2590359?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&#38;pf_rd_s=center-41&#38;pf_rd_r=07M2C2GXWQNSHJAMDYKJ&#38;pf_rd_t=201&#38;pf_rd_p=250314601&#38;pf_rd_i=B000MD4DGM"">these lines</a>, which failed horribly. Apparently it uses only software decoders, rendering a full-screen <em>really</em> slowly if you don&#8217;t have the processor for it. Heh, which I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Micro Center also stocks Bawls. In cases. On sale. :D</p>
<p>Running through algebraic methods for solving polynomial fractions&#8230; heh. So much better than using trig.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really&#8230; happy? this morning. Not totally sure why.</p>
<p>Also horribly paranoid about my speakers going off in class. And about missing a shift at work that I don&#8217;t know about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m in Calc II, which really happens more often that I&#8217;d like to think. There are three white legal pads on my left with an assortment of notes scattered about therein. Also a quad-shot iced vanilla latte, which is fortunately <em>not</em> scattered about therein.</p>

<p>Kurt made an excellent latte the other day&#8230; like an actual latte, with the foam bit on the top. Also caramel. My goal is to become something near to the baristas that my managers are.</p>

<p>A lot of people have iPhones in this place. I suppose I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised&#8230; I&#8217;m waiting for <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/tag/google%20phone/"">Google&#8217;s market entry</a>. ;)</p>

<p>Bawls in my bookbag. (No, I&#8217;m not going there.) The plan for the later afternoon involves Celeste driving about w/ Max/me, which includes stops at Micro Center (ext hd &#8211; Celeste &#8211; and several cases of Bawls) and Ikea (food, Swedish furniture).</p>

<p>I like Ikea. I have a lighting piece from there, also a bamboo stalk.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is not trivial.&#8221; Quote of the day. I must add that to my language patterns.</p>

<p>The coffee shop needs a new website. Spent&#8230; half an hour toying with a design sketch last night, after homework/labwork. Not sure if that was a good idea, given that I finished up at 2:45-ish, but it felt good to make something pretty again. Heh. Pretty.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure (<code>/me feels himself begin to ramble</code>) what I&#8217;m going to do with calc. &#8230; Actually, no, pretty sure I know. I need to get my head back in gear. Withdrawing from the class for this semester isn&#8217;t an option &#8211; it&#8217;s a hefty amount of credits, and I&#8217;d drop to part-time status if I removed it from my schedule. Which would mess with loans and things. Messy.</p>

<p>Anyway. Going over partial fraction decomposition. Algebraic manipulation is something I can do. Not so much integration with trig.</p>

<p>Anyone who reads this and is considering this school in the future &#8211; unless you&#8217;re smarter than I am (of which the odds are decent), take calc I first.</p>

<p>This song is called The Force of Gravity, from Emotional Technology &#8211; BT&#8217;s&#8230; what, 2004 release? Something along those lines. He edited the track for his The Technology EP, which I think is a better mix than the original. Though I don&#8217;t have an mp3 of that. My apologies.</p>

<p>And I think I&#8217;m done. Not proofing this entry, excuse typos. No photo either; taken nothing of caliber lately.</p>

<p><em>remember the words we use to speak<br />
the promises made have turned to all apologies<br />

Our&#8230; restroom partitions are to be replaced. Along with the dryer, which apparently has reached the status of Electrical Hazard.</p>

<p>Welcome to <span class=""caps"">IIT</span>, where a new wireless network is created every eight hours to make up for such deficiencies as these. Heh. I love it here.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s Wednesday, and <code>/me opens Bawls</code> this will be the 18th bottle in my collection. Because yeah, I collect these. I expect that space will become an issue before this is all over.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve just <del>notest</del> noticed (wow) a patch of black ink stains on my shirt. That&#8217;s a shame. This shirt has been with me through many trials and difficulties, but it looks like it&#8217;s not actually impervious to ink.</p>

<p>Math recitation was yesterday. Uneventful, except that (1) I was able to connect to the wireless network (never happens in that room), and (2) I made it to the correct room on time. The <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/2007/09/18/trains-and-sewing-machines"">Russian TA</a> kind of apologized at the end of his example set, saying something to the effect of no, you will never see this material after calc is over. We just use Maple for stuff like this.</p>

<p>And the professor is starting to use multiple colors for the integral graphs. Though I&#8217;m not as thoroughly lost as before.</p>

Also with a fixation on world domination, and I&#8217;m pretty sure we won&#8217;t be able to top that in this production. Though maybe. I&#8217;ve been typecast for this one &#8211; a sarcastic, calm twin by the name of Leslie, which pretty much fits perfectly.

<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>A woman walks in, wearing a forest green mock turtleneck. Black felt hat, front pinned up with a large black flower. Back of the shirt is pulled up; she probably doesn&#8217;t know. Her teeth are misshapen; she&#8217;s wearing glitter on her face. She is black, middle-aged.</p>

<p>She&#8217;s looking for a slice of pizza, but you can&#8217;t really tell &#8211; the pronunciation is hampered by her teeth.</p>

<p>Trying to be elegant, but she doesn&#8217;t have a chance. Not here. Not with these people.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>My family came to the campus this weekend. Walked past an older guy on a bench, rolling a joint. He looked up, then continued with his work. I hope my brothers and sisters didn&#8217;t notice.</p>

<p>Death to the white man, white woman walk over black man like a dog. Graffiti on the subway.</p>

<p>The ghetto apartments. Little girls with beads in their hair. Little plastic beads, one by one.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s probably my age. Maybe a little bit younger. Through the door to the next train car, the one marked &#8216;employees only&#8217;, and &#8216;danger&#8217;. Would you want to buy socks, sir.</p>

<p>There are never any white children on the train.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve only been here for a couple of months. Heh. A middle-class white male, straight out of nowhere.</p>

<p>The sudden racial mix didn&#8217;t bother me for the first few weeks, which was slightly odd, now that I think about it. There are probably four non-whites in Rhinelander, and everyone there knows who they are. Now I&#8217;m here &#8211; Chicago&#8217;s diverse enough, let alone <span class=""caps"">IIT</span>. Half the population&#8217;s from India. (Bit o&#8217; exaggeration there, yeah.)</p>

<p>And what I&#8217;m saying here is hardly new. It just bothers me that this is all so obviously cyclical &#8211; established racial inequity turning back to itself. If that makes sense.</p>

<p><code>/me muses</code> I don&#8217;t think I meant this entry to be about racism. I think I was going to compare a certain view of life to a Fourier series. But I guess this makes sense too.</p>

2007-10-21 04:28:38,Hello again.,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/642.jpg"" /></p>	<p>First off, there are a couple changes around <a href=""http://ikebowen.com"">the site</a>. &#8230; Okay, the site was rewritten. Completely. The only thing that wasn&#8217;t redone is the comments handler, and that only because it doesn&#8217;t exist just now. (upd &#8211; comments now in place as of 3:23am.)</p>

<p>Notes on what exactly was done (because&#8230; I do that):</p>

<p><strong>layout</strong><br />
Kept the three columns, stripped out everything that wasn&#8217;t mission-critical. Colors, extra content. Out. Images associated with anything are placed to be the focus of the entire page &#8211; only thing that competes with them is the signature. Which is fine.</p>

<p><strong>interface</strong><br />
Ajaxy. Partly because it adds interest to the visuals, partly because it&#8217;s just fun to play with. <a href=""http://script.aculo.us/"">Script.aculo.us</a>. Woot.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no search, and there&#8217;s no archive. The lack of an archive is intentional &#8211; I set this up to focus on the current situation, if you will. The search box will likely be added in a bit. Along with comments. Maybe.</p>

<p>Now&#8230; yeah. It&#8217;s very, very bare. Heh, in my defense, the code that went into that is really quite complicated. Especially the content menu over on the right there. :/</p>

<p>Anyway. All of this works in all the decent browsers as far as I can tell, though Internet Explorer does some odd things with anti-aliasing when opacity is messed with. Moral of the story: use <a href=""http://getfirefox.com/"">Firefox</a>.</p>

<p>Pffff.</p>

<p><strong>in other news&#8230;</strong><br />
Winston &#8230; oh. Interrupted thought. I&#8217;m catching up on Bionic Woman (which really isn&#8217;t that terrible, despite the inherent clichÃ©), and <del>Sara</del> Sarah <del>Corvis</del> Corvus (apparently I can&#8217;t spell) just made an expression that Torie definitely could have pulled off. Heh.</p>

<p>But yeah, met up with Winston and Aunt Beth Friday afternoon. Dinner at&#8230; somewhere Mexican. Metra/CTA back to campus. Hot Fuzz, Portal. Sleep at 4am.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a Star Wars exhibit running at the Museum of Science and Industry. Allegedly excellent, nationally presented by Bose. But should you ever decide to go there, make sure that your tickets are procured in advance, e.g. before they sell out. Or you will spend a moderate amount of time in transit for absolutely no purpose, except to see a bold, 36pt Times New Roman notice that (we&#8217;re sorry) all tickets have been sold.</p>

<p>Heh. Yeah, that was our situation. All in all not a bad thing. Gave us time to wander a bit of the loop, see what&#8217;s to see at Millennium Park. Spent 20usd on coffee (hooray gift cards).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s 11:16. Hungry, tired, slightly dazed. I don&#8217;t want to sleep. Or no, I don&#8217;t want to sit in the dark, waiting for sleep to appear. Do you get that? I think everyone does.</p>

2007-10-22 17:37:24,"Well, yes. A sofa.","<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/643.jpg"" /></p>	<p>Right, it&#8217;s monday again (odd how that happens), and I seem to have set this morning&#8217;s alarm early by roughly two hours. Pah.</p>

<p>Large box. Not to be confused with <a href=""http://orange.half-life2.com"">The Orange Box</a>, though that&#8217;s quite good as well. G4 calls Portal &#8220;pretty much the best thing ever&#8221;, and now that someone&#8217;s got the <a href=""http://www.primotechnology.com/2007/10/17/half-life-2-portal/"">portal gun jamming with HL2</a>, there&#8217;s really no reason not to just buy <a href=""http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=package&#38;SubId=469"">the entire bundle</a>. 50usd for three epic games isn&#8217;t bad.</p>

<p>On an unrelated note, advertising that assumes the idiocy of the target audience sickens me. &#8230; Though granted, if their target audience <em>are</em> in fact idiots, I suppose they have the right. But still. Scholarships with <a href=""http://dynamic.media.adrevolver.com/adrevolver/banner/104431.swf?clickTAG=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.adrevolver.com%2Fadrevolver%2Fhref%3Fbanner%3D104431%26place%3D13419%26rnd%3D1193066611200&#38;clickTag=http://ikebowen.com"">eligibility tests</a> asking the sum of $999,999+$1 (apparently &#8220;a whole lot of cheddar&#8221; is considered correct) to things like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is market research?</p>
<p>Encyclopedia Britannica Definition:<br />
Study of the requirements of specific markets, the acceptability of products, and methods of developing and exploiting new markets.</p>
<p>Your Definition:<br />

</blockquote>

<p>Come <em>on</em>.</p>

<p>(Oh, Emma. I found an escalator named Otis. Though I don&#8217;t think it was female.)</p>

<p>The plan was to sleep. Right through until 4pm, then have dinner and sleep again. Riiiight.</p>

<p>Heh, then Celeste called. Moral of the story: phone off when sleep&#8217;s the object. But she offered a trip to Ikea. Couldn&#8217;t really turn that down.</p>

<p>I love Ikea, but if my credit card could speak, it would mock me every time I walk through the motion-activated revolving doors (are those really a good idea anyway?). Blast those crafty Swedes and&#8230; and their low prices. And meatballs. Only $4.29 a plate.</p>

<p>But yes, my goal was a chair (one of those sitting things, Celeste). I have a loft coming at some point (the card got particularly sarcastic on that order), and I wanted something to go beneath it. Though for all that Ikea is quality and cheapness (and joy and joyness), their furniture line really isn&#8217;t designed for the student budget. The futon/cushion combo was roughly $160 (parenthetical expression here for the sake of consistency) &#8211; not bad, but still slightly expensive.</p>

<p>But then there was the sofa.</p>

<p>Dark grey with a hint of blue. Roughly #474E52, I&#8217;d say, with a matching footrest that looks enough like a <a href=""http://search.live.com/images/results.aspx?q=weighted+companion+cube"">weighted companion cube</a> to make the entire $150 package entirely worthwhile.</p>

<p>Also converts into a bed. So that&#8217;s good too.</p>

<p>The tricky bit was getting it into the back of Celeste&#8217;s &#8217;96 Grand Prix, which for the record was not designed for furniture transportation. Imagine two collegiates, outside of Ikea, manhandling a largish box through a car door that really was about two inches too small, with tired Ikea shoppers trying not to look like they were paying avid attention.</p>

<p>We did get it in there. And we did bow, though no one applauded. This surprised me, honestly. Twas a considerable accomplishment, after all. And they did sit there and watch the entire <del>debacle</del> success.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any artists in here? [silence] I guess they&#8217;re all in the Aesthetic Calculus class. &#8230; The one that uses the book &#8216;Numbers Are Your Friend&#8217;. &#8211; calc instructor</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The final challenge: driving back to campus with a large box (see the above sign) blocking any view of whatever might be behind. Scrawling <span class=""caps"">LARGE</span> <span class=""caps"">BOX</span> onto the thing (incidentally, that was all Celeste could see in the rearview mirror &#8211; <span class=""caps"">LARGE</span> <span class=""caps"">BOX</span>) wasn&#8217;t really our idea, I admit. There was some pansy in a little white car up ahead, a box a third the size of ours in the back seat. Labeled <span class=""caps"">LARGE</span> <span class=""caps"">BOX</span> in white block print. <code>/me shakes head</code> They do not know the meaning of <span class=""caps"">LARGE</span> <span class=""caps"">BOX</span>.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s pretty much the end of the story, I think. Extracting the boxed sofa wasn&#8217;t bad, as keeping the box intact was no longer a concern. Heh.</p>

<p>Anyway. Happy Monday. Go do something unexpected.</p>

<p>Buy a sofa.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv

<p>2:13 ay em. Thinking like an insomniac, though I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d sleep if I wanted to.</p>
<p>A call&#8217;s scheduled for tomorrow (later today, I guess) with the guys from back home and their attorney. By &#8220;the guys&#8221; I mean my bosses, all three. Though likely only two for this round. The&#8230; hm. The legal situation that&#8217;s been in the air for the last 6 months is approaching the final stage, and I&#8217;m still involved. Be careful around me. I&#8217;m a hardened criminal, I am.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: I&#8217;m not, and the above sentence is, for all practical purposes, purely hypothetical.)</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>People are&#8230; an odd bunch, to say the least. My relationships are messing with my mind just now. All non-romantic, fortunately. A couple of them tie back to the sorting set I had earlier &#8211; people that you want to friend versus people that want to friend you. And the few instances where those two coincide. Like most things, it&#8217;s a simple matter. Ostensibly, not so much.</p>
<p><em>how can I tell you just all that you are</em><br />
<em>what you do to me</em></p>
<p>I hate seeing people going through inner unrest. Truly.</p>
<p>There are few ways to better get my attention than to let me see you clearly for just a moment, for with that motion you catch my interest. Drawing people out of their walls is&#8230; something I work on.</p>
<p>Two twenty two.</p>
<p>There is always something going on inside everyone. Even the emo, I promise. Every person that you see has a story, and most of them are hiding their story from you.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s late. Should probably sleep.</p>

<p>10:05, math. My eyes are killing me and my forearms are covered in hives. Yet again.</p>

<p>Hm. I walked to class with a fellow who&#8217;s ever so certain how he feels, but can&#8217;t deal with the fact that how he feels doesn&#8217;t match reality. Reminds me of me, a few years ago. Granted, he&#8217;s lived a bit longer than I have, but that doesn&#8217;t have a whole lot to do with it.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t gotten to bed before 2am in a while. Ech.</p>

<p>Things to do today:</p>

<ol>
<li>Finish CS201 lab for Friday; figure out how to get a TA to do an in-class review of it without actually being in class</li>
<li>Complete CS100 midterm; pretend that I remember all of the sorting algorithms</li>
<li>Receive legal counsel</li>
<li>Pound math homework</li>
<li>Get Amtrak tickets for this weekend</li>
<li>Make it to play rehearsal on time</li>
<li>Avoid new-supervisor training for as long as possible</li>
<li>Figure out why jstubbs is having category issues with <a href=""http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?pid=160009#p160009"">ike_slideshow</a></li>
<li>Potentially port this site over to <a href=""http://jquery.com/"">jQuery</a> (way to jump on the script.aculo.us bandwagon, mate. <code>/slap</code>)</li>

<p><strong>friday, 8:45</strong></p>
<p>Twas a meticulously planned trip, really. Inasmuch as I meticulously plan anything. Wake up with the phone alarm, 6:30. Leave for Union Station, 7:30. Arrive 8:00 for the 8:25 Hiawatha to Milwaukee. Meticulous enough.</p>
<p>Wake up at 8:05, holding my phone. Insert contacts, 8:07. Throw on clothes and leave the building, 8:14. Realize that there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to get to Union Station in ten minutes, 8:14. Call a taxi, 8:15. Watch three other taxis pass a block away, and conclude that the taxi really isn&#8217;t coming, 8:26.</p>
<p>So yeah. Missed that one. I blame the sleeping on not getting to bed until 4 (math is not my friend this semester), but I&#8217;m somewhat surprised that I managed to silence my phone without remembering taking such action.</p>
<p>But there you are.</p>
<p>Heading home is always so&#8230; stressful&#8230; In preparation, I mean. (You&#8217;ll excuse me while I continue to whine a bit?) The carpool leaves Friday afternoon out of Milwaukee, meaning that I miss two CS labs and a math course with homework due. This nearly always comes down to staying up ridiculously late Thursday night to finish the math, having missed work earlier in the week to complete the CS labwork.</p>
<p>Mm. Amtrak&#62;Greyhound. For future reference, the Student Advantage discount card only works for tickets purchased three+ days ahead of time.</p>
<p>For sound cards with no wave channel for recording, note also that one can rip Pandora streams (or anything else) manually by connecting the line-out port to the line-in jack, using a 35mm audio cable. Tis an ugly hack, but it works. Two point four hours of <a href=""http://pandora.com/stations/cac6e642bb309495e1ca513b3d46e099f38872cc5d2b7170"">floor();</a> queued up.</p>

<p><strong>much later</strong></p>

<p>At home now, Saturday night. The house is quiet, virtually no ambient noise with the exception of my harddrive. Bare as well (the house), what with the out-moving and all. They&#8217;re leaving on the 30th. It&#8217;s starting to feel weird for me, knowing that my family&#8217;s going to be quite literally out of the country for a year. Not inaccessible, but&#8230; just very far away.</p>

<p>Though apparently their housing contract over yonder comes with <span class=""caps"">DSL</span>. So that&#8217;s good.</p>

<p>For those that I haven&#8217;t told the story to, my dad&#8217;s sabbatical-ing (&#8221;[taking] a prolonged hiatus, typically one year, in the career of an individual&#8221;) in Germany, bringing the family along for the colloquial ride. Which is cool, really &#8211; Mom and Dad have wanted to take the mÃ©nage offshore since more or less forever, but it&#8217;s never quite worked out. This time, it has &#8211; every little detail (and I mean that &#8211; <em>everything</em>) has worked out perfectly. I&#8217;m fairly sure it&#8217;s God saying &#8216;yep, this is the time&#8217;.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is their last weekend here. Celebrated Aaron&#8217;s Nov1 birthday this evening. Watched a movie with my little sister cuddled next to me. Hauled furniture to the basement and migrated Dad&#8217;s work materials to his laptop. If it&#8217;s weird to me now, I can&#8217;t imagine how the last few weeks have been for them.</p>

<p>Going to bed now, for the last time here at home till next year. I&#8217;m not sure where I&#8217;m going to go when school&#8217;s out, come to think of it. Given that another family will be in this house until mine comes back. &#8230; An apartment isn&#8217;t quite practical yet, unless I find someone to share it with. And I really don&#8217;t want to impose on anyone in town. I&#8217;d stay in Chicago, but I have a job here&#8230;</p>

You like your surroundings to be simple and as stylish as you.&mt= You like life rugged and rough round the edges.

When it comes to art, you're definitely unconventional. You like to think differently, always from another perspective. You have a good sense of humour. As for music, it's the soundtrack to your world. An open road, your favourite tracks - clichÃ©s are there to be enjoyed! Your choice of treat reveals either real exhaustion, or maybe a bit of laziness? Either way you're never happier than when you are rugged, and snuggled up, eyes shut.&lvt= You're a real romantic and a bit of a dreamer. OK, life may not be a movie, but what's wrong with thinking it is? When you think of freedom - you think of the opportunity of the city. Big enough to house all your ambitions, where people can be whoever they want.&ft= Life is exhausting and you never seem to get enough rest - poor thing! Working hard or playing hard, you just have to get some more rest. For kicks you like to switch off and immerse yourself in another world. You are thoughtful and imaginative - you like to look at life from a different perspective. Cultured and creative. When it comes to holidays, you like to explore and immerse yourself in another culture. Always on the go, you take in as much as you can. You find it hard to switch off, as you like to learn all the time. What grosses you out?

<p>She is with the sun<br />
And it&#8217;s out here</p>

<p>But where are you&#8230;</p>

<p>Go on a journey<br />
And roam the streets<br />
Can&#8217;t see the way out<br />
And so use the stars<br />
She sits for eternity<br />
And then climbs out</p>

<p>She&#8217;s the glowing sun<br />

So come out</p>

<p>I awake from a nightmare<br />
My heart is beating<br />
Out of controlâ€¦</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve become so used to this craziness<br />
That it&#8217;s now compulsory</p>

<p>And here you are&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m feeling&#8230;</p>

<p>And here you are,<br />
Glowing sun&#8230;</p>

<p>And here you are,<br />

Glowing sun&#8230;</p>

<p>And here you are,<br />
Glowing sun&#8230;</p>

<p>And here you are&#8230;</p>

<p><em>If I had to / I would put myself right beside you<br />
So let me ask / Would you like that?<br />
Would you like that?</em></p>

<p>Effing&#8230; blast. Just took a call from my boss back home.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I told this story yet, nor am I sure if I&#8217;m authorized to do so. So. This involves a company. Company A. I worked for Company A, as part of Group Q (to choose an arbitrary identifier). Group Q did well and brought much success to Company A. I felt good to be an intern there.</p>

<p><em>And I don&#8217;t mind / If you say this love is the last time<br />
So now I&#8217;ll ask / Do you like that?<br />
Do you like that?</em></p>

<p>Then Group Q went all indie and started Company B. Did their level best to keep everything legal and completely above board. Company A did not like this &#8211; they had lost an excellent group and now had clients leaving to go with Company B. Naturally, they sued.</p>

<p><em>No</em></p>

<p>Unexpectedly, they included me in the suit. Little old (well, not really) me, at one point an intern for Group Q, now being included in this <del>ridiculous</del> corporate lawsuit.</p>

<p>Which was okay for a while. I didn&#8217;t actually have to do anything except throw a signature on whatever papers had my name printed. The rest of Company B was going through hell, yes, but I&#8217;m just an intern.</p>

<p><em>Something&#8217;s getting in the way<br />
Something&#8217;s just about to break<br />
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane<br />
So tell me how it should be</em></p>

<p>So I leave Company B and go off to school. Life is relatively good. Math decides to be nasty, but that&#8217;s beside the point. The point is that, halfway into the semester, I get a call from my boss. While boarding public transit with my cousin, I get this call &#8211; apparently the lawsuit is entering legal arbitration and depositions are required of all related personel. Apparently, that meant me as well.</p>

<p>Thursday morning &#8211; conference call with me in my room in Chicago, three attorneys and a court reporter back at Company B. Twas not a difficult call, really. As our attorney said, they weren&#8217;t trying to be evil to me. I&#8217;m just a kid. &#8230; A kid that they&#8217;re trying to use in part to nail Company B, yes, but a kid nonetheless.</p>

<p><em>Try to find out what makes you tick / As I lie down<br />
Sore and sick / Do you like that?<br />
Do you like that?</em></p>

<p><em>There&#8217;s a fine line between love and hate / And I don&#8217;t mind<br />
Just let me say that I like that / I like that</em></p>

<p>The questions generally followed a single theme &#8211; did you, in fact, take any data away from Company A that would have been used by Company B to achieve such spectacular and immediate success?</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t, of course. But I did make a backup. And therein lies today&#8217;s problem.</p>

<p><em>Something&#8217;s getting in the way<br />
Something&#8217;s just about to break<br />
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane<br />
As I burn another page<br />
As I look the other way<br />
I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane<br />
So tell me how it should be</em></p>

<p>The tape backup system had ceased to function properly at one point. So I made an emergency backup on cds, just to ensure that, at the end of the day, we&#8217;d have our data.</p>

<p>My testimony included the fact that there were six or seven cds. This being due to the limited capacity of a single CD, and the larger-than-700mb server hard drives.</p>

<p><em>Desperate, I will crawl / Waiting for so long<br />
No love, there is no love / Die for anyone<br />
What have I become</em></p>

<p>Which made sense to me. Apparently they took that to mean that I had made a backup, and made six or seven duplicates.</p>

<p>&#8230; I think the proper response to that assumption is a simple &#8216;wtf&#8217;. Especially when one considers that the backup in question occured early on into my work at Company A, and any data from that time would have been more or less useless by the time Group Q went indie.</p>

<p>sigh. Anyway. Apparently this thing didn&#8217;t die for me as hoped for.</p>

<p>My train is here.</p>

<p><em>Something&#8217;s getting in the way<br />

<p>I stopped in at Walmart this morning to pick up a tie. The perfect travel mug continues to elude me.</p>

<p><strong>new music day</strong><br />
To The Voices in my Head (Perpetual Loop)<br />
The Adventure (Angels &#38; Airwaves)<br />
Stolen (Dashboard Confessional)<br />
Dusk and Summer (Dashboard Confessional)<br />
Capricorn (30 Seconds To Mars)<br />
From Yesterday (30 Seconds To Mars)</p>

<p>Ethics aside, I think there&#8217;s only one really <em>good</em> reason for buying music. Familiarity with your library, and a collection of songs that you really like.</p>

<p>If that&#8217;s not for you, download away.</p>

<p>Paying 1usd (or 70 Microsoft points..) ensures that you only buy the music that you absolutely want, and keeps you from downloading entire albums at a time. While torrenting 80 songs at a time might not be a bad thing (again, ethics aside), I&#8217;ve found that it kinda results in me not knowing what&#8217;s in half of my music library. You could argue that hand-picking every song you get sacrifices variety, the element of surprise. Yeah, maybe. In that special &#8220;oh, hey, I put my iPod on shuffle and I have <em>never</em> heard these songs before!&#8221; kind of way. Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but I like to know my music. Actually <em>know</em> the music, as in listen through each new song to the point where you can hear nuances that you&#8217;d miss if they were in the background on the radio. I like that.</p>

<p>Then there are the ethics, of course. The <span class=""caps"">RIAA</span> wants you to pay, but not get a string-free product in return. Evidently the average music-buyer can&#8217;t be trusted with a legal mp3. They might, you know, send it to someone. Heavens.</p>

<p>But yeah &#8211; should you pay for music? I used to be terribly hard-lined about that. Torrenting music = bad. Not so much anymore. I&#8217;m not an overt music pirate. I have zero p2p clients on this machine. I rationalized that downloading music legally with Ruckus and then converting them to mp3s with <a href=""http://soundtaxi.info/"">SoundTaxi</a> was fine. (Anthony found a temporary way to get a free registration of SoundTaxi, making the deal more attractive&#8230; heh.)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s come down to this, though. Download a few songs. If you like them, buy them. I acquired Dusk and Summer (album) via Ruckus, but bought two of its tracks yesterday. Good songs that, I suppose, I wanted to thank the band for.</p>

<p>Though it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess how much of that actually went to the band. Ah well.</p>",exigraff wp_posts.csv

<p>I&#8217;m not fond of dreams, and would avoid them entirely if I could do so and remain sane. Tonight&#8217;s features: a simulation in which a business team was put into a structure built of large, rapidly eroding sandstone cubes, watching a train go by with thousands of sheep inside being treated not at all well, and trying to save the life of some random portly guy in the middle of an executive meeting.</p>

<p>Also, having the delusion that my bottom teeth were loose.</p>

<p>So given that I&#8217;m not really steady on my feet, allow me to point you in several <em>other</em> directions&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>divide by zero</strong> <a href=""http://fonts.tom7.com/"">fonts.tom7.com</a><br />
A collection of Truetype fonts that, if you&#8217;ve ever liked anything connected to Tim Burton, you will probably like.</p>

<p><strong>SuperCollider</strong> <a href=""http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/"">supercollider.sourceforge.net</a><br />
Not the song, the audio/wave synthesis server. Of course.</p>

<p><strong>Portal: The Flash Version</strong> <a href=""http://portal.wecreatestuff.com/"">portal.wecreatestuff.com</a><br />
The guys at <a href=""http://wecreatestuff.com"">wecreatestuff</a> (of <a href=""http://nh2.wecreatestuff.com/"">Nightmare House</a> quasi-fame) apparently saw the demo of Portal, and saw potential for a stripped-down 2d Flash version. Heh. It&#8217;s actually quite good (but no substitute for <a href=""http://orange.half-life2.com/portal.html"">the real thing</a>).</p>

<p><strong>On an unrelated note</strong>, I&#8217;m seeing something of a resemblance between the iPhone&#8217;s reception (pun!) and that of the Zune. Yeah, the iPhone introduced new (<a href=""http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Apple-alternatives-rival-the-iPhone/2007/10/24/1192941124957.html"">well&#8230;</a>) technologies, arguably more so than the Zune did. However &#8211; both were market entries for their respective companies, and the OS they shipped with did little to fulfill the hardware potential.</p>

<p>So there.</p>

2007-11-01 21:56:11,things on my mind,"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/657.jpg"" /></p>	<p>(warning: self-absorbed whinefest ahead. approach with caution.)</p>

<p><strong>school</strong></p>

<p><em>calc II</em><br />
Currently passing, not by much. &#62;_&#62; It&#8217;s quite true, what others have said &#8211; get through high school without a problem, enjoying being above the curve, only to run into the situation where you&#8217;re abysmally normal and run the risk of failing like everyone else. Garr.</p>

<p><em>tech comm</em><br />
Not a chance of failing. But I should probably do the read/response questions someday. &#8230; Yeah.</p>

<p><em>finances</em><br />
Bothersome that you can&#8217;t see your bill online. (Which reminds me&#8230; <code>/me goes off to pay off the Chase card with a $14ish convenience charge to have the payment posted in time, something of a necessity in order to ensure that the paycheck coming tomorrow can be applied to today&#39;s card payment... bah</code>) I still have a Bursar&#8217;s hold on my registration. Wonder if that&#8217;s why my grades aren&#8217;t being posted&#8230; nah, that shouldn&#8217;t be the case. Though all of my money should be in at this point&#8230; my payment and the scholarships. Should be.</p>

<p><em>loft</em><br />
A trivial thing to be all tense over. I ordered a loft. Because the space would be nice. The loft company didn&#8217;t get back to me for a week and a half, so I called them. Supposed to be here soon. I disassembled the bedframe and threw it and the mattress into the hall storage room. For the time being, not having any clue when the loft people were going to show up. &#8230; Apparently using the storage room for anything is a policy violation. sigh</p>

<p><em>work</em><br />
Shift starts in half an hour. Working with a fellow who, while quite nice, makes things slightly awkward. :/</p>

<p><strong>personal</strong></p>

<p><em>family</em><br />
They made it to Germany, safely and without being shaken up too much. Huzzah! Had a vid call with them this morning. Heh, they&#8217;re dealing with jet lag. Looks like all&#8217;s well with them, however. Not so much my sister who is remaining State-side to finish high school at semester. Ill and missing the family. Poor girl.</p>

<p><em>friends</em><br />
The one that decided to join the Navy and move out, before graduating high school. The one who&#8217;s lost another relationship. The one that I really don&#8217;t want to lose contact with, and there&#8217;s little chance of that happening, but it bothers me nonetheless. The potential one. The one I lost.</p>

<p>All in horribly ambiguous and melodramatic terms, yes. Allow me my ambiguity and melodrama.</p>

<p>[ <em>a synonym for &#8220;general state of mind&#8221; beginning with &#8216;f&#8217;</em> ]<br />
I&#8217;m horribly off-kilter. I have no idea why.</p>

<p><em>work back home</em><br />
One day I should learn the difference between omitting information that really doesn&#8217;t need to be brought up, and omitting information that I <em>think</em> doesn&#8217;t need to be brought up, but really should be. &#8230; Actually, I should just learn to disregard what I think more often. &#62;_&#62;</p>

<p><em>somewhere I belong</em><br />
My home no longer exists, in practical terms. And won&#8217;t for another year. Still no idea what I&#8217;m going to do for Christmas break. Or freaking summer, for that matter. I want to go home, but I don&#8217;t think I can justify getting an apartment. Even if I work 55hrs/wk like last year.</p>

<p>Wonder if they&#8217;d give me a raise&#8230;</p>

<p><em>hair</em><br />
Aha, something superficial and ultimately unimportant. My hair is mostly gone. I&#8217;m wearing my glasses again. &#8230; Never was one for gradual changes in personal appearances. Just huge jumps from unassuming high school kid to pseudo-punk businessguy to collegiate geek. Bah.</p>

<p><em>sleep</em><br />
Still hate dreaming. Still just want to pass out for a few hours and dream of nothing. Instead of&#8230; mistreated sheep. And executives in a crumbling sandstone building. Wtf.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>Oh well. At least my brokerage account only lost $46.43 today. Would have been more if I had more funds to invest, after all.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I hate psuedocode. Mapping is useful. <span class=""caps"">UML</span> diagrams and the like. &#8230; I suppose psuedocode is useful as well. &#62;_&#62;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve posted this song before. Tis a good one. One of the interns from this summer introduced me to the group&#8230; heh. John. His name, you see. &#8220;Shut up, Gwen.&#8221; Quote. Apparently he had just been ditched by his date for the evening, with Gwen Stefani on the radio.</p>

<p><code>/me looks for camera</code></p>

<p>Anyway. I&#8217;m sure I have nothing very useful to say, aside from the above prose which could conceivably save your life at some point.</p>

<p>With that, enjoy your weekend.</p>

mind if we take a little side trip matey???<br />
I didn&#8217;t think so<br />
not quit accourding to plan<br />
problems arouse, ensued, were over come<br />
captian<br />
i think the crew, meaning me as well<br />
were expecting something a little more shiney<br />
what with the isle of de murte going under the sea<br />
that and all the treause with it<br />

does me<br />
it&#8217;s a key<br />
no<br />
much more better, it is a drawing of a key<br />
gentlemen<br />
what do keys do?<br />
keys unlock things?<br />
and whatever it is that this key unlock, inside will be something valueble<br />
no<br />
so we&#8217;re seting out for this key<br />
you&#8217;re not making any sense at all<br />
what would be the use of setting out for a thing that needs a key that we don&#8217;t have when whatever needs the key, which we don&#8217;t have, needs unlocking<br />
so were setting out for this key<br />
you&#8217;re not making any sense at all<br />
so&#8230;<br />
do we have a heading<br />

<p>I was walking toward the <span class=""caps"">MSV</span> exit, toward the far side of the security desk. A girl that I&#8217;d never seen before came in the entrance, and started striding &#8211; e.g. was walking quickly &#8211; toward the exit. Her timing and my timing matched, and we arrived at the exit door simultaneously. This was awkward. I couldn&#8217;t speed up much; the pace was already fast. I couldn&#8217;t slow down &#8211; we were already at the door.</p>
<p>Me: &#8220;well&#8230; this is awkward.&#8221;<br />
Her: &#8220;here, you go first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hehehe&#8230; hm. Ha. I was walking back from rehearsal a few minutes ago, running through a scene in my head. Consequently, I said nothing verbally, but wore the facial expressions that I&#8217;d have used for the scene.</p>

<p>Regrettably, the guy in front of me turned around for no particular reason and saw my sarcastic-pity face. Heh.</p>

<p>Sunday was one of the more excellent of its kind. To be sure. An afternoon with not one, but two friends from Rhinelander High. Turned out that UW Madison was sending a bus of students to the Museum of Science and Industry (Star Wars!). By coincidence, another friend from high school happened to be in the area as well. Excellent, as stated. Things of note from that trip:</p>

<ul>
<li>Walking past the <a href=""http://flickr.com/search/?q=msi+chicago+trees"">Christmas tree display</a> &#8211; this short middle-aged woman <em>leaps</em> out from behind the Denmark tree and starts enthusing about something-or-other in Spanish. There was no obvious target for her attack; I assume she just really liked the tree.</li>
<li>Trying to get to Water Tower Place with Emma, walked into a hotel for no real reason. Emma on cell: &#8220;Yep, okay, we just entered the Ritz Carlton. Leaving now.&#8221;</li>
<li>Somehow, Wohlleber and I lost the name of our beloved <a href=""http://www.learner.org/resources/series75.html"">Destinos</a> star. Raquel, of course, of killer-shoulder-pad fame. (For the uninitiated, Destinos is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Destinos&#38;oldid=171473004"">an educational television program created by Bill VanPatten, who was, at the time, completely tanked</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<p>At any rate&#8230; heh. It&#8217;s Wednesday now. I&#8217;ve just come from math152&#8217;s third exam, which really has gone much better than either of the previous two. Not that this means much (the others were abysmal), but it&#8217;s still something.</p>

Real life goes undefined,<br />
Why must you be so miserable?</p>

How can this be so miserable?</p>

<p>Registration is now complete; decided that I do actually like my advisor. That happened, I think, when I called about a prerequisite and he assumed immediately that I had missed him. But there you are.</p>

<p>Anyhoo, Aesthetics, Verbal/Visual Comm, Brain/Mind/Behavior, Calc II (again&#8230; &#62;_&#62; grade replacement), and Intermediate Web Design and Management. Woot. I&#8217;m actually kinda excited for this term. Not so much the math bit, but between Aesthetics and Web Design things should go well.</p>

<p>Something to try if you&#8217;re bored: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/ads/create/"">Facebook&#8217;s advertisement system</a>. Plug in a dummy address and enjoy hours of amusement, discovering obscure demographic statistics. You too can known how many Italian singles over 60 are on Facebook. Take pride in the knowledge that roughly 180 married Canadian conservatives between the ages of 13 and 14 are online. And don&#8217;t get me started on Pakistan.</p>

<p>In unrelated news, <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/www.imdb.com/title/tt0442933/"">Beowulf</a> was released the other day, dropping an at least somewhat impressive 72% on Rotten Tomatoes.</p>

I don&#8217;t mind the internationals here. It&#8217;s just that they have no concept of personal space.</p>

<p>And it doesn&#8217;t help when they approach the cafe in pairs, then ask for a payphone in halting English.</p>

<p>A bit of background, though. An obscene number of people come to the cafe every <em>hour</em> looking for a bathroom. We were discussing ways to effectively answer this question &#8211; among them pulling out this large sign with directions to the nearest facilities (having them in robocode would be fun), or (for maximum entertainment) sending them four or five blocks down to the nearest Starbucks.</p>

<p>The couple I referred to weren&#8217;t students; I imagine visitors from somewhere. Guy: &#8220;Where is &#8230; payphone?&#8221; Coworker: &#8220;You know, I&#8217;m sorry, but we don&#8217;t have any payphones here.&#8221; Me: &#8220;Although there&#8217;s a Starbucks down the street&#8230;&#8221; Suddenly-Very-Excited-Guy: &#8220;&#8230; Starbucks?!&#8221;</p>

<p>Heh, and off they went. In search of a payphone at your local Starbucks. I regretted that for about ten minutes. Then I realized that he was so <em>happy</em> about there being a Starbucks to begin with, I may have done him a favor after all.</p>

This site gets some really <em>odd</em> referrers. Really odd. And because I yam who I yam, I check for them often. :) There was a hit earlier this morning from <a href=""http://pressemitteilung.ws/"">pressemitteilung.ws</a>, apparently something to do with <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/ike_slideshow/"">ike_slideshow</a>. (However, <a href=""http://pressemitteilung.ws/search/node/ike_slideshow"">searching the site</a> results in search tips put in terms of blue smurfs. Which is funny on several levels.) Then, of course, there was someone who searched a Mandarin image site for <a href=""http://so.image.qihoo.com/view.html?kw=blow&#38;pos=108"">blow</a> and ended up with a photo from <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/416/on-a-day-like-today"">a fairly old entry</a>. In comparison, having someone manage to end up here from a literally no-name <a href=""http://lending-solutions-online.com/"">lending service</a> is less odd. Even though there&#8217;s no conceivable reason for someone to land here from investigating an easier financial life.</p>

<p>It more or less just hit me this evening that my family left. On the upside, this means I can more fully empathize with my sister, who was hit with that waaay before they actually did leave.</p>

<p>And excuse me for going on about this, by the way. I get melodramatic every once in a while.</p>

<p>Being unaffected by this was something of a relief. Realizing that I was unaffected, I mean &#8211; having my family suddenly up and go to another continent for twelve months stirred up little additional emotion. In my defense, I didn&#8217;t really see them anyway. School and such. Bit of a distance between Chicago and home; I dealt with the separation itself without issue, and distance was arbitrary. Kinda.</p>

<p>My sister and I went to the Thanksgiving&#8230; gathering, I guess, at my dad&#8217;s family&#8217;s&#8230; place. Locale. Cousinfest and lots of sleep. Good to see everyone, as always. My (nuclear) family called in a couple times (o the wonders of Skype). Worked out well. Got there on Wednesday, stayed until early Saturday evening.</p>

<p>Heh, then we dropped off the dog at what is usually considered &#8216;Home&#8217;. There&#8217;s another family there at the moment, taking care of the place. It was that moment &#8211; walking through the house and seeing someone else&#8217;s life pasted over the top of ours &#8211; that I actually realized they were gone.</p>

<p>And they&#8217;ll be back, of course. We talk daily, in one medium or another. I feel a little silly for being thrown so much by seeing someone else&#8217;s toaster oven on the counter. Not so much for the picture frames boxed up and stored away &#8211; that one is more excusable, I think.</p>

<p>The piano was sitting in the quiet, back in the parlor. The clip above was recorded on my trusty Nokia somethingorother that&#8217;s never really liked making phone calls. (I consider this a reasonable excuse for the lack of audio quality.) &#8230; I miss that piano. Out of tune and everything. I swear, if they put ivories on it to replace the ones bit off&#8230;</p>

<p>I kinda want to end this with a list of things I&#8217;m thankful for, in <a href=""http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?q=list+thankful&#38;as_maxm=11&#38;as_miny=2007&#38;as_maxy=2007&#38;as_minm=11&#38;as_mind=21&#38;as_maxd=23&#38;as_drrb=b&#38;ctz=360&#38;c1cr=11%2F21%2F2007&#38;c2cr=11%2F23%2F2007"">typical Thanksgivingblog fashion</a>.

2007-11-30 08:52:35,friday (or: three days to monday),"<p><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/674.jpg"" /></p>	<p>My brain is slowly starting to die. Or dying, if you will. I knew this, but did not realize it until now. Heh. Little things like suddenly losing 25 cents in nickels on a countertop (whoever stole it was a fool &#8211; $130 in twenties and fifties, right next to them), or considering today&#8217;s math homework, visualizing the assignment, three rows of three problem numbers each, and concluding with the total six. Then later looking at the same assignment, seeing two rows of three and one of two, and thinking &#8220;ah, splendid &#8211; only eight&#8221;.</p>

<p>&#8230; My roommate just laughed. In his sleep.</p>

<p>2:35am, I&#8217;ve just come back from the vending machines and am about to embark on that noble adventure known as Math Homework. My desk is somewhat cleaner than it was yesterday (meaning that there are only two keyboards left, and the three spare hard drives are now on the shelf), but does feature the following:</p>

<p><strong>a server called &#8216;emo&#8217;</strong><br />
Which really should be a film with poor box office performance that rapidly develops a cult following subsequent to its (HD)DVD/Blu-ray release, for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>At any rate, the server in question has a Pentium 4 (2.4ghzish), 512mb memory and a newshiny 400gb sata. Total investment: almost exactly $400. Which is more than it could have been, yeah, but not that bad either. It&#8217;s turned into a bit of a project for ijiti and me, arhhook being the most recent addition to our fledgling team. Granted, we have no goals. But as my Tech Comm class has proven time and time again, a team doesn&#8217;t need goals. Indeed, nearly entire class was playing <a href=""http://www.armagetronad.net/"">Armagetron</a> today. Even the prof had a go at it: &#8220;Well, it looks like everyone&#8217;s playing Tron. &#8230; I want a turn.&#8221;</p>

<p>But yes. Check out http at <a href=""http://emo.ath.cx"">emo.ath.cx</a>. There&#8217;s not a whole ton (metric) open for public access just yet, I&#8217;m afraid &#8211; the fileserver is locked (leave a comment if you have a really creative reason for wanting in) and&#8230; yeah, that&#8217;s pretty much it. Except for Armagetron. :) <a href=""http://internap.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/armagetronad/armagetronad-0.2.8.2.1.gcc.win32.exe"">Download the client</a> and away we go.</p>

<p><strong>comics</strong><br />
Though just two, actually &#8211; a print of <a href=""http://dresdencodak.com/cartoons/dc_028.htm"">Traversing the Luminferous Aether</a> and one of <a href=""http://dresdencodak.com/cartoons/dc_021.htm"">Epilogue</a>, both from <a href=""http://dresdencodak.com"">Dresden Codak</a>. If you&#8217;re not familiar, scan through the Wikipedia article on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity"">technological singularity</a> before beginning your visit. That&#8217;s how I was taught.</p>

<p>By the way, did you know there was a <a href=""http://www.singinst.org/"">Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence</a>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the coming decades, humanity will likely create a powerful artificial intelligence. <span class=""caps"">SIAI</span> exists to handle this urgent challenge, both the opportunity and the risk.</p>

<p>When Firefox has more than twenty tabs open, largely to list notable things for later posting, &#8230; something. There&#8217;s got to be a conclusion to that.</p>

<p>An abbreviated list, then. <a href=""http://www.theonion.com/content/radio_news/president_to_investigate"">President To Investigate Where Laundry Chute Goes</a> (Onion Radio News &#8211; an excellent episode).

And <a href=""https://emo.ath.cx/"">A Server Named Emo</a>, once again (redesign&#8230; :/ not much).</p>

<p>Also, an excellent example of Tasteless Advertising: <a href=""http://clicktorrent.info/phpAdsNew/adimage.php?filename=regbanner_468eng_2.swf&#38;contenttype=swf"">Pheroline</a>.</p>

<p><strong>to those opposing The Golden Compass</strong>, specifically <a href=""http://iit.facebook.com/group.php?gid=13663055161"">the 99k on Facebook</a></p>

<p>You have the right to oppose, yeah. And if you&#8217;ve read the book and considered Pullman&#8217;s comments verbatim before choosing sides, well done. You have my utmost respect.</p>

<p>But if you hear that the book is about killing God and immediately start making picket signs&#8230; &#62;_&#62;</p>

<p>Though, I reconsider. If you actually start making picket signs, that&#8217;s one thing. Your mindset is alarmingly close to that of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Phelps"">Fred Phelps</a>, and I recommend that you avoid the media for this reason.</p>

<p>The vast majority of you, I would guess, have not only not read the book, but have simply added a tally to the petition because a friend invited you. After all, it only takes a single click to choose sides. Do <span class=""caps"">NOT</span> support &#8220;The Golden Compass&#8221; (sic), where the operative word is in caps to remove all doubt concerning which side you should be on. And with more than 98 thousand members, how can they be wrong?</p>

<p>&#62;_&#62; This upsets me.</p>

<p>They might be right, it&#8217;s true. But I very much doubt that there is a single &#8220;right&#8221; in this scenario. If I remember the book at all (it&#8217;s been a few years), it&#8217;s an exemplary work of fiction. It decries corrupt organized religion, it&#8217;s quite true. And while this is enough to set the activists aflame (the same ones who interpreted The Passion Of The Christ as an anti-Jew documentary &#8211; read the bleeding subtitles&#8230;)&#8230; Honestly.</p>

<p>To those who out of hand refuse to see the film or read the book: I hesitate to call you a fool (collectively), as you may have valid reasons. Sweeping generalizations have no place in this. Though do consider this (please) &#8211; there&#8217;s a difference between observing heresy and taking part in it. Thus, it is hardly a sin to read the book in order to evaluate it. Nor, I would argue, is it evil to attend a rave &#8211; the difference lies in whether or not you&#8217;re actually taking the pill. Seeing the film is not equivocal to rejecting God. I promise.</p>

<p>Zune v1 is not Zune v2. Version 1 was Media Player 11 with support for this brick called a Zune. Version 2 is a completely new piece of software, and is decidedly not Media Player.

<strong>things I believe</strong>

Note: these things should theoretically be fairly obvious to the somewhat more than casual observer. Apparently they’re not so much. Need to work on that.
<ul>
<li>God exists.</li>
<li>Humanity has ultimately screwed itself over.</li>
<li>A fix for this exists, by name of Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>Jesus Christ is far more than a fix. So, for that matter, is the rest of the Trinity.</li>
<li>Which also exists.</li>
<li>Free will, on the other hand, does not exist. In an absolute sense. Ask me sometime.</li>
<li>Pepperoni ftw.</li>
<li>The purpose of humanity is more than pepperoni.</li>
<li>Once eternity is the priority, everything else more or less falls into place.</li>
<li>Secular culture has the upper hand in musical quality. Switchfoot is an exception to this rule.</li>
<li>Human relationships are incredibly important.</li>
<li>Human relationships can really, really suck. Avoid them like the plague.</li>
<li>One can be offended and highly amused at the same time.</li>
<li>Observing culture for the sake of observation is not equivocal to being swallowed by it.</li>
<li>But one thing can lead to another.</li>
<li>That said, watch your relationships.</li>
<li>Or just avoid them. Rationale: there’s someone better for them, odds are, and for their sake you might as well let them go anyway.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>So hear this please…</blockquote>
<strong>what I am</strong>

This is for the sake of those who try to draw me out of my little corner. I appreciate the effort, really. But if I don’t let you in, let it go. … And yeah, I’m a little tense at the moment; forgive me.

I am split fairly evenly down the center of… whatever the essence of self is. Soul, being. What have you. One half is relatively pleasant and likes to smile. He’s nice, and had dinner with you the other night. The other half is bitter and resignedly pessimistic/cynical. Very little hope for any given situation, and the odds are good that the situation doesn’t ultimately matter anyway.

Between the two of them we have my collective soul, if you will. Hangs in the background, not because it couldn’t handle the foreground, but because there’s no need to move into the foreground whatsoever. Generally. Exceptions exist.

The collective soul doesn’t place a whole lot of value on its own self. If the cause is worthy, it’ll give itself away to the success of someone else’s venture. If the day’s up for it.

It vacillates between wild creativity and largely complete emotional stagnation. … Though more of the latter as of late, but anyway. Given this, it may or may not be obvious what’s going on internally. Depending on whether or not it matters that you know, or to what degree introversion is the course of the day.

It could be your best friend. Not an enemy, though. It’ll fade into the background long before that happens. Or will at least make that attempt.
<blockquote>And do you ever lay awake at night?
And do you ever tell yourself don’t try?

<strong>and why</strong>
<ol>
<li>Raised Christian</li>
<li>Chose Christianity and rationality, and no, they are not mutually exclusive</li>
<li>Discovered musick and the value therein</li>
<li>Fell in love, choked it, hurt the girl, and lost touch</li>
</ol>
<strong>afterthoughts</strong>

It’s odd how the human mind can hold contradictory ideas at the same time. Love and cynicism, hope and despair. Yeah, I’m being melodramatic. It’s the emo in me, and you’ve read this far.

But until I get the contradictions sorted out, this is who I am. And no, I am not going to elaborate.

The above may or may not apply on a daily basis.

<p>I miss you guys already.</p>

<p><strong>later</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s Tuesday now, by about three hours. I&#8217;ve just gotten back from watching The Office with Nathan and Vi- &#8230; Vin, Van&#8230; Liz, that&#8217;s who it was. Liz. Ha. Episode upon episode of the stuff. Things noted: chipmunks are notorious for eating clementines, and generally spreading their peels all over the place. (If you didn&#8217;t know that, don&#8217;t fret &#8211; most kids today aren&#8217;t aware.) Also, Nathan&#8217;s dad was raised by chipmunks.</p>

<p>Ah, and I hit a deer today. I&#8217;d like to say that the deer hit me, just because that&#8217;s the sort of turn-o-phrase that should go in there, but it didn&#8217;t. I definitely hit it. I did brake, though. In my defense. Thought process: &#8220;Ahh, popcorn chicken. Ohh, deer. Oh dear. Brakes? Yeah, probably, but not too fast &#8211; there&#8217;s some sort of light behind you and it might be a car. &#8230; Blast, nearly missed it. Didn&#8217;t sound too bad, though the deer did just go sailing off to the left&#8230; But you&#8217;re alive and the windshield is intact. Hopefully it&#8217;s not a huge thing, or we&#8217;ll have to go to Green Bay in the truck. And that only has one working speaker.&#8221;</p>

<p>I left messages at two auto shops in town, meaning to only call one but forgetting which was which. Northwoods, East Side. Pretty close. The latter message was left at 3am-ish, and went like this: &#8220;Hello, bla bla broken car bla bla, call me at seven-one-five, four-&#8230;. shoot, I&#8217;ve forgotten my number.

<p>Right, existentialistic moment over. Suffice it to say that it&#8217;s <del>Wednesday</del> Thursday (presence of mind: zero), and I&#8217;m not really looking forward to the rest of Christmas. I&#8217;d go back to Chicago, but I do have some remnant of my nuclear family left here. And various holiday-related duties to attend to. Shopping, for example, which should probably happen before the 25th.</p>

<p>Friends are going to start showing up in town&#8230; tomorrowish. And this weekend. A good lot of them are looking forward to coming home, but this is the first year that I&#8217;ve noticed how much the holidays themselves are <em>not</em> looked forward to. &#8230; Or not the holidays, I guess, but the large amount of inconvenience and small amount of positive&#8230; something. Whatever. They&#8217;re not all as shinywonder as they were when you were five, which makes sense and is to be expected.</p>

<p>&#8230; I&#8217;m hesitating here. Not totally sure whether to go all emo and agonize generally about life in general, or to say something respectable and surprisingly thoughtful about the world at large, and <em>x</em> in particular. It amuses me &#8211; enough people read this in a personal context that I can&#8217;t just use it as a mind-dump, and enough people come here for practical purposes (e.g. Textpattern stuff, Zune stuff, design stuff) that more than just personal stuff should be written. This stopped being strictly a personal site at some point, which is odd.</p>

<p>bleh</p>

<p>Am at work (surprise), trying to figure out how to use this reporting app. The degree of its un-user-friendly-ness can only be a result of special effort.</p>

<p>Like the <span class=""caps"">DMV</span>, which apparently has no phone. I was told this by the highway department. Apparently our local government tends toward the inaccessible as well. <code>/me muses</code></p>

<p>The car gets its headlights fixed/replaced tomorrow. That&#8217;ll afford a bit more flexibility. Apparently you need those to drive after dark.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s 1:32 (so not quite), listening to Angels And Airwaves again (did you know, I love you?). That&#8217;s Angels <em>And</em> Airwaves, mind you, none of this ampersand business. I told iTunes this, and Zune had a fit. Knocked out a good chunk of I-Empire, for reasons unknown.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, the band isn&#8217;t even <a href=""http://www.angelsandairwaves.com/"">consistent</a> with the <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/angelsandairwaves"">name</a>... bah.</p>

<p>Anyway. I&#8217;m downloading the first season of Eureka, trying to get the torrents far enough that the <span class=""caps"">AVI</span>s don&#8217;t have too many holes in them. Progress is slow, dialup over cell. Though I think my average is at least 10kbps.</p>

<p>You know&#8230; heh. I love my family. We were watching the second episode a while ago, and Grandma came down the stairs. Wanted to make sure everything was okay, that we were comfortable and all that. She&#8217;s so very&#8230; <em>pleased</em>, I think. Pleased that her grandkids are all here, in the cabin. This was sort of her life&#8217;s dream, I think. She told me about it, years ago when I&#8217;m pretty sure she didn&#8217;t think I understood, said that it was a vision she had. She&#8217;s so happy. It&#8217;s beautiful. I love it when people become happy again.</p>

<p>Gift-opening is tomorrow at some point. My sister&#8217;s supposed to arrive before then; am hoping she makes it in time. I only have this shirt for my selected (by lot) cousin, and while it&#8217;s a nice shirt, methinks what the sister brings will make the package a bit more satisfying than the shirt by itself. Nine years isn&#8217;t quite old enough for a single shirt to make a good gift.</p>

<p>Christmas has been good. But it&#8217;s difficult, you know, to get past &#8211; transcend, I suppose &#8211; the logistics and miscellany that the holiday involves. Clear your head and forget the declaration (defamation, desecration) of good gifting to all people (eBay: &#8220;ikebowen, get the gift you really wanted&#8221;; read: yes, we know what you&#8217;re thinking) and remember something simple. I&#8217;d argue that you can&#8217;t really stay sane without infinity in focus. Though perhaps it takes a degree of insanity to do so. Paradox. Hoorah. Tis the season.</p>

<p>The photo for this entry (and more in <a href=""/photog"">photog</a>) comes from this last week, walking the shore with my cousins. Sent the following to a friend from that night, and I now address it to you. O reader blessÃ©d, though belated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m out on the beach of Lake Michigan, watching the waves in moonlight. Kind of at peace with life. So&#8230; I guess I&#8217;m wishing a bit of something similar for you this Christmas. Something like that.</p>

<blockquote>I’m just a normal boy / That sank when I fell overboard
My ship would leave the country / But I’d rather swim ashore
Without a life that’s sadly stuck again / Wish I was much more masculine
Maybe then I could learn to swim / Like ‘fourteen miles away’

You’re floating up and down / I spin, colliding into sound
Like whales beneath me diving down / I’m sinking to the bottom of my
Everything that freaks me out / The lighthouse beam has just run out
I’m cold as cold as cold can be

<em>I want to swim away but don’t know how…</em></blockquote>
It’s odd, really. I’m experiencing a growing sense of unfamiliarity, I think, with reality. And I can’t really point to anything specific, which is frustrating. (Discounting a general inability to estimate time or have a consistent sense of its passing, which has happened before.)

I’m pretty sure that part of this comes from feeling distanced – separated, more than usual, from my friends and family. Close relationships. My family’s overseas, and will be for quite a while longer. My closest friends have all (yeah, all) had major life changes happen while I wasn’t watching.

And I think my phone’s starting to die. (This actually seems a reasonable progression, given that it’s forgotten what ‘down’ means.) Either that or I don’t actually exist. :)

I’ve wondered that, actually. The feasibility of one simply being a construct, granted consciousness to serve in someone else’s delusion. It’s similar to the theory in which we exist in the mind of God – as we create systems able to build and hold a simulated reality in memory, plotting and calculating every vector, mightn’t our reality be held within the mind of God, the only being able to be conscious of and maintain every particle in the universe?

4:26am. My sleep pattern is, once again, entirely screwed up. Finished season one of Eureka (great show, btw), am now looking for a theatre playing Sweeney Todd. I can’t find any; apparently it’s left the cinemas after ten days of screen time. Strange.
<blockquote>Where is the coastguard / I keep looking each direction
For a spotlight, give me something / I need something for protection
Maybe flotsam junk will do just fine / The jetsam sunk I’m left behind
I’m treading for my life, believe me / (How can I keep up this breathing?)

Not knowing how to think / I scream aloud, begin to sink
My legs and arms are broken down / With envy for the solid ground
I’m reaching for the life within me / How can one man stop his ending
I thought of just your face / Relaxed, and floated into space

<em>I want to swim away but don’t know how…</em>

Now waking to the sun / I calculate what I had done
Like jumping from the bow (yeah) / Just to prove I knew how (yeah)
It’s midnight’s late reminder of / The loss of her, the one I love
My will to quickly end it all / So thought no end my need to fall

Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all

Into the ocean (goodbye) end it all (goodbye)
Into the ocean (goodbye) end it all (goodbye)

<em>I want to swim away but don’t know how
Sometimes it feels just like I’m falling in the ocean

1. Dialup. … Anger.

2. Alltel’s online account manager. Works sometimes, but the trick is fooling it into letting you inside. Passwords don’t stay the same, see – you change your password, you can come in. If you let your password get comfortable, the system gets crafty and changes it to something unexpected. Then (if it’s feeling particularly evil) it’ll kick you out of the system right when you’re about to view your bill, and send you to their business services page.

It’s good to smile, yeah. And if you don’t smile yourself, you can still catch some of it from the guy next to you.

Calah’s changing her name, Anthony’s found someone new and the world keeps on turning. Linkin Park in February, woo. Roadtrip, oow. Took Hannah to Wausau the other day – roadtrip therapy. Turns out that shopping is also a powerful form of therapy (it’s astonishing how long they can spend in American Eagle…), and it’s hard to justify not opening a new credit card to get that 10% off. Bills are going to be interesting this month. :)

My family got back from Salzburg, from what I hear. A vacation in eastern Europe. The Family von Bowen. Ethan’s become quite a good <a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/bowenethan"">photographer</a>; glad he’s along to document <a href=""http://www.thebowens.ws/"">the trip</a> with <a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/vonBowens"">Mom</a>.

Bleshkabob. My mind is scattered. :) No sleep + strange illnesses + work + coffeecoffee.

Oh, funny story. I dropped calc II from my spring semester schedule, freeing up some time. Wanted to compare notes with Erhan (guy from school), find a CS course in common. Being in Turkey, he wasn’t conscious last night at 8pm <span class=""caps"">CST</span> (assuming that he’d be online if he was), so I ran a script through the housing department’s website to pull out student email addresses and IDs, looking for Erhan’s, so I’d be able to subsequently pull up his schedule for next term. Heh. Hooray network security. I love the internet.

<strong>spring schedule</strong>
Aesthetics (Snapper – heard <a href=""http://ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=125531"">good things</a> about him) – TuTh, 3:15-4:30
Verbal and Visual Comm (Gehrs) – MW, 3:15-4:30

Intermediate Web Design/Management (Gehrs) – M, 6:25-9:05pm

The battery on my media player went out last night; dreadful thing to happen before a drive. But you notice a lot when the world isn’t being drowned in sound. Clouds of snow writhing in the glare of someone else’s lights, patterns the wind has chiseled out of the road ahead of you, patterns that could probably cure cancer if anyone knew just how to interpret them. ‘<span class=""caps"">DEAD</span> <span class=""caps"">END</span>’, blinking at you in muffled yellow as you signal left. Snow snarling at itself, chasing the tires of <span class=""caps"">SLX</span>-572. Little things.

Rhinelander’s best-kept secret: the Walmart deli. I think we’re going to see Sweeney Todd tonight (unrelated).

Taking the sister down to Two Rivers tomorrow; she’ll be staying with the cousins while she recovers. The doctor yesterday said her spleen was doing reasonably well, though her general illness … level is kind of hovering. It’ll be a while.

And off to school on Sunday for me. Back to the city. Woo. Classes start on Tuesday (coat check), meaning that the web design class won’t show up until the following Monday. Pff. I do hope that it’s a decent course… not like okay-here-open-frontpage-and-save-as-html.

Back at school now. In the mailbox, crammed: a variety of sample Post-it products, two surge-protector catalogues, a donor card from the Red Cross (O+!), a note from a younger cousin with some photos, a thank-you from Samaritan’s Purse for designating them as the charity of choice for my scholarship thing (someone opened it and stole the gift copy of the book Rebel With A Cause, but no matter, the letter was largely intact and that’s what counts), and a check from Scottrade that was allegedly mailed to my home address (how did they find out about my school address anyway?).

Bills. Suck.

Malodorous dorms. Apparently a sewage pipe burst somewhere. Why this should affect the hvac system, I do not know. It’s better this morning.

Went to Jewel last night, picked up 210usd in groceries. And that’s without the wheat grass.

2008-02-04 05:16:51,these are my keys,"<img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/710.jpg"" alt="""" />

These are my keys. Say hello. And because I have nothing to write about, I will now introduce you.
<ol>
<li>Unmarked car key, unlocks/starts the trusty 1996 Intrepid. This car is not technically mine (actually not at all), but my sister and I are the only ones left in the States just now and she drives the truck. It’s a good car. It just won’t start when it’s below zero. Also the woofer in the front passenger door rattles.</li>
<li>This is a keychain from a prom at my high school, probably my sophomore year. I didn’t actually go; they were passing these out as extras from the event. … I still can’t believe there were extras; this is probably the best boxcutter I’ve ever used.</li>
<li>Imprinted with the digits 479. I don’t know what that means. Had to stare at this one for a minute before figuring it out; this key opens my filing cabinet.</li>
<li>Black hemp bracelet with a pewter decorative piece. (The design reminds me of something that might be used as a tattoo, and I looked up the appropriate <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo#Decorative_and_spiritual_uses"">Wikipedia article</a> for a reference. Know this: “Conspicuous tattoos and other body modification can make gainful employment difficult in many fields”.) Abbey (sister) ordered this online for me. :)</li>
<li>Another prom keychain, though I did manage to attend the thing this time. (Free tickets; unrelated story involving super secret undercover agents.) You can’t see it from this angle, but there is a quarter lodged in the frame. (It’s a frame.) This is not the original quarter, I’m afraid; quarters have been slipping in and out of the frame of their own accord for some time now. I’ve learned to accept this.</li>
<li>Brass-ish keychain with “Canada” on the back. The front has a moose, and also “Canada” again. It’s from Canada. My family went there, which was something of a surprise at the time. They brought this back to remind me where they had gone.</li>
<li>K649, Salsbury Ind Mailboxes, Los Angeles, Cali. This opens my school mailbox.</li>
<li>Medeco, ADD23, 4, 30. Made in the <span class=""caps"">USA</span> (woot). Opens my dorm door.</li>
<li>The… something like the fourth flash drive. The others have gone, in like fashion as the hermit crabs. (Rest in peace, Father John.) 512mb, has a portable software suite thing on it. I think. Haven’t actually used this in months.</li>
<li>MK552, Steel Case, Grand Rapids Michigan. Has kind of a block of adhesive residue on one side, like there used to be a label or something. I have no idea what this opens or why I have it. But “Steel Case” sounds like it could house something valuable, right?</li>
<li>Hiding behind Prom Keychain #2. This… frick. Where is this from. Oh, right – this is from the old office I worked at. I think I was gone the day keys were collected. Oh well.</li>
<li>That is a key, yeah; has a black plastic sheath on the top. Opens the luggage locks. Master. Apparently they’re <a href=""http://www.masterlock.com/"">tough under fire</a>.</li>
<li>103, Helix. Has a six manually etched into each side. Opens cash box #6 at the cafe, for you would-be thieves. The safe combination is 872971<sup class=""footnote""><a href=""#fn84604316047a6b5cb6cdbe"">1</a></sup>; press the pound button after entering the code.</li>
<li>This is my first attempt at chain mail, and is, ultimately, a failure. I keep it to remind me that manual/artisan labor is perhaps not a viable career choice.</li>
<li>This key is possibly hidden behind #6, and is therefore not itself numbered. It is very small. I’ll call it the key to my heart, because I don’t have one of those and I don’t know what it is actually for.</li>
<li>Not a key; the little ring to the right of the boxcutter. This once held a pocketwatch in place. That particular pocketwatch has since either been shattered or passed on to Aaron; I forget which, but I’m pretty sure Aaron has it either way, along with my ex-motherboard. I now have a pocketwatch with “Remington – America’s Oldest Gunmaker” on the back of it, through no fault of my own.</li>
<li>Spork. Titanium. Japan. “Titanium Japan”. No no, it’s okay, you didn’t know. <a href=""http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/tools/8ace/"">It’s not too late</a>.</li>

I am annoyed with the tax system. Like the rest of the States, I realize. But consider the following:
<ol>
<li>Though I pay for my own tuition, I am still technically a dependent of my parents. I therefore cannot submit this expense when filing for a return.</li>
<li>I had a europacific fund for a while. Like a month. (I know, sucky investment tactics.) I nonetheless paid foreign taxes. Which is another slew of paperwork. Even though the dividends were all of 49 cents. And the taxes on that were $2.25. (Though they were nice enough to give me a foreign tax break of $2.00 on the return. That was pleasant.)</li>
</ol>
In other news, to convert more or less any video file to a Zune-friendly format, one can use the following mencoder command:
<blockquote>mencoder [input] -o [output.mp4] -oac lavc -ovc lavc -of lavf -lavcopts aglobal=1:vglobal=1:vcodec=mpeg4:acodec=aac -af lavcresample=24000 -vf harddup -lavfopts format=psp:i_certify_that_my_video_stream_does_not_use_b_frames -ofps 30000/1001 -vf scale=720:480</blockquote>
The result is an mp4 file, it’s true, but the file in question is mux’d just so that the Zune can handle it without any further work by the Zune software. It’s a beautiful thing. (Thanks <a href=""http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/mencoder-users/2006-June/003420.html"">Niedermayer and jsd</a>.)

Also in the works, a hack gateway between sms and <a href=""http://grandcentral.com"">Grandcentral</a>. (Grandcentral being sort of a personal switchboard for all of your phones. Handles incoming calls and reroutes them based on your rules, plus a broad set of what <a href=""http://www.chriskranky.com/chris_kranky/2006/10/grandcentral_an.html"">Kranky</a> called ‘stupid phone tricks’ back in 2006. But it’s pretty awesome, where ‘awesome’ means ‘cool enough to warrant acquisition by Google’.)

The only issue with the system is that one has to initiate outgoing calls from their website – this allows them to call you, then connect you to your target, making available such features as call logging and call recording. I don’t have an internet package for my phone, but I can now send a text to <a href=""http://emo.ath.cx/"">emo</a> (‘call [name]’) and it’ll set up the call serverside. Many frustrations with cURL and… and stuff. I’ll post the code when it’s more stable.

Linkin Park on Wednesday. Driving up to St Paul around 11, grab food, rock out for a couple hours, start packing caffeine and head home. Should make it back by 5am Thursday.

My family’s in Italy, as it turns out. Pray for them, if you’re so inclined. (The rest of you can think happy thoughts in their direction.) Sister’s mostly recovered from mono; heading back home from her time-of-healing with the cousins.

And me… I’m filing taxes and wanting the snow to end. Zoning to <a href=""http://social.zune.net/artistdetails.aspx?aid=ea5e0700-0600-11db-89ca-0019b92a3933"">Royksopp</a>. Much Ado seems like it’s going to be canceled, which sucks. A lot. We’ve put so much time into that play. But one of the guys nearly went off to be part of <a href=""http://www.cwtv.com/shows/beauty-and-the-geek"">Beauty And The Geek</a>, another one dropped last night (for reasons reasonable and understandable), and… yeah. Sigh.

Also, I don’t want to be in love. Again. Still. Pretty sure.",exigraff wp_posts.csv

2008-02-11 23:55:41,hello,"<blockquote>Hello.

I am Isaac Bowen, and it is my job to introduce myself, as long as you are all held captive for the next five minutes. Because this could get out of hand fairly easily, I’m going to divide this up a couple times, beginning with a standardized personality test. From there I’ll touch on my quantified (x, y and z), further divided into a brief summary of my personal and professional life. I’ll then briefly move into the more abstract characteristics of my very being, but only briefly as that sort of thing can get needlessly existentialistic.

Introductory psychology courses will inevitably force several personality tests down the student’s throat. This is convenient for introductory communications courses.

Carl Jung, that crazy, crazy man, had a few ideas concerning how personality was structured. According to the test based on his ideas, my personality type is <span class=""caps"">INTP</span>, colloquially known as that of the architect. “Greatest precision in thought and language. Can readily discern contradictions and inconsistencies. The world exists primarily to be understood. 3.3% of the total population.”

<a href=""http://introspectives.org"">introspectives.org</a>, which is slightly less well known than the honorable Carl Jung, classifies me as exactly 74% introverted. More articulately, I am avoidant, often late, rarely prepared, non-aggressive, but <em>slow</em> to judge others and <em>patient</em>, which are probably the least damaging traits assigned to me. … Take what you can get.

As long as I’m covering the arguably factual, let me backtrack and give you an idea of what my history looks like, beginning with my entire personal life, condensed into two points.

I come from a Christian household, a family a seven. Seven is also the number of pets I have gone through, including rabbits, a couple of needlessly aggressive birds, and a fairly large assortment of hermit crabs. They are all dead, including the hermit crabs, all for entirely different reasons.

I’ve lived in north-central Wisconsin for most of my life, and now live in a charming little alcohol-ridden locale called Rhinelander, which currently holds the Guinness record for most bars per capita. We are <em>so</em> proud.

Professionally, I am a freelance web developer, and have been moving from internships to contract projects to personal endeavors for some time now. I am currently working as a technical analyst for Heck Capital Advisors, a financial investment firm, and as a barista at the campus cafe. Coffee equals love. That is all.

And these are all things one might find on a resume; reasonably informative, but perhaps the intangible qualities are more interesting. My personality and life history are more or less split down two lines: intellectual and creative. I have a very strong drive in both directions. Hammering code, musing on the nature of metaphysical dimensional reality, these are not boring things. Neither is sitting down at a piano for an hour or so to just make music.

These two often separate tendencies largely define who I am as a person and how I think, what I do. Most pertinently, this is why I am a web developer/designer. As a developer, the intellectual tendencies are satisfied with building and coding functional systems. As a designer, I can create and arrange, add visual nuance, make things that catch and engage the eye.

To conclude – everything is still in progress. Rather than an introduction to who Isaac Bowen is today, I consider this to be more of a status report, if you will. An update on how much progress (or regression) has been made thus far. My short-term foreseeable future is more or less set – school here for a couple years, then probably a few years of freelancing. Possibly a “real” job somewhere.

Or perhaps not. Things are still changing, and there will always be much to learn and much to become.

On that appropriately inspirational note, thank you for your time.

Goodbye.</blockquote>

I think Turks have this subconscious urge to go grocery shopping on the coldest days of the month. Pretty sure, actually.

Very overwhelmed, suddenly. Too much input, too many inputs. Like fifty tabs up and a couple hundred unread messages (heh). Clutter. And I think my grass has gone into shock; the weather out isn't really conducive to healthy greenery.

Made it to the church mostly on time. Twas a serious chore staying awake, though worth it. Someone asked me why I go there, among other things. This is a fairly standard question, to which there are accepted answers.

Coming to a city, where there's so much more - and less - of everything, and so many smarter people with better-sounding answers than youâ€¦ You quickly learn to either learn why, or have your beliefs quickly decimated.

I go to church to be reminded of what is Real. It's not about <em>religion</em>. Is's a new <em>mindset</em>. Completely reoriented in the context of God who is infinite, that created our infinity, that specifically created us, the finite, and has stayed with us in our now.

This is the context, the canvas. Religion concerns itself with the particulars, which is fine and appropriate. The particulars are important. Some are all-important. But religion gets so much stuff <em>wrong</em>. ... Which is why I go to church, ironically. To be reminded, reoriented. It's not about the religion. And yeah, this sounds lofty and abstract. I don't know all of what I'm talking about yet. But I do know that I am only alive when I remember this, that my life is not my own and that I have given it to Someone who is infinitely and inherently more. It's so, so easy to forget. Ironically.

Christianity is peculiar.

Things are starting to add up, and it's only... what, the third week of the semester? Something close to that. I'm reminded why I've grown into avoiding relationships. Just getting close to other people's is stressful.

And sixteen hours of interstate hell later, we’re back. Alive, most importantly.

The concert was amazing. Absolutely incredible. And by “the concert” I mean Linkin Park. The opening band (<a href=""http://www.chiodos.net/"">Chiodos</a>) was very good. Coheed and Cambria was… Coheed and Cambria, I suppose. If you like that sort of thing, they performed admirably. But LP’s performance is going to mean that all of the concerts in my foreseeable future will be something of a letdown.

Coheed left the stage, taking all of the on-stage equipment with them. The LP concertdirectorguy knows what he’s doing. Completely bare stage, with the exception of Brad Delson’s guitar pedal and a keyboard/mic, with which the show began. Shinoda’s scratch tables came up through the floor on one side, Bourdon’s drums on the other.

… I don’t even know what to say. The play set was a good mix of old and new music, some close to what it was like on the albums, some completely remixed. … They played fricking three encores. You knew they were coming, of course; the house lights never came up. But they pulled off some serious manipulation of the crowd between the encores and the twenty minutes of making everyone stare at a bare stage before the concert began. People were going insane. :)

The drive up to the Cities was uneventful. Six hours of unworrisome highway. It was, however, snowing when we left the concert venue. This should have served as a warning, and things would probably have been better had we just gotten a hotel room for the night. But no. Took ten hours (count them, ten) to get back, driving behind largely invisible semis and wondering where exactly the driving lanes have gone to.

But we’re alive, and the concert rocked. Not that I’d want to do it again anytime in the near future, but there you are. And check <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/photog"">photog</a> and <a href=""http://iit.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2001023&amp;l=3df4b&amp;id=1602840136"">Facebook</a> for more photos.

I’m not a photographer. But I take pictures, and after I’ve taken as many as I can, I bring them back to the laptop and find the good ones and edit them until they look exactly the way I want them to look. Then I resize them to 600 pixels wide and save them as jpegs compressed at something like 90%, and close the editor. I don’t save the source edits, and I don’t save a highres copy.

This guarantees two things. One, that I can never really revisit any of the edits without starting over completely. Two, I can never take a closer look at any finished product. It’s over and done and can be seen in any sort of larger size without, again, starting over. It’s gone. (‘Got a sort of woody quality to it – <em>gone</em>…’)

I’m not sure why I do this. But it’s very intentional, every time. Sixhundredpixels and discard the source. The 600 comes from the width of this site’s content column; it’s been a constant for the last two or three design revisions. Consistency. Large enough to get the idea, but small enough to be useless for anything except a glorified thumbnail. The edits happen in the first place because the first shot is never the way I see it. Want to see it. The shadows aren’t deep enough. There’s too much red in your skin, and the sky was brighter than this. The sky should be brighter than this. I fix things. Open her eyes a little wider, mend the leaves where they’re torn and dying. Fix the memory. Straighten and frame the memory. Then burn it. But take a polaroid first for posterity, hang it on the wall.

<em>This isn’t me, this isn’t real
It’s such a long way down…</em>

Lots of code. Code and psychology and bits of Rauschenberg’s bed. Work has begun on another project for the cafe, this time a little more functional than… marketingish. I do better work in practical terms than in the aesthetic. And Stargate Atlantis lends itself to code work. I know not why.

Though there is a redesign coming for this site at some time in the future. I’m kinda excited. No demo; it wouldn’t make any sense as a static preview. I know this disappoints you, my readers, but be assured that the both of you will survive.

Things to note: <a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23204875/"">a particularly barbed article</a> from one Winda Benedetti concerning Jack Johnson and his ever inspired attacks on video games. And his self-promotion, but hey. Perks of the job.

Also <a href=""http://travian.com"">Travian</a>, but a little nagging feeling says I’ve mentioned that already.

:/ The Stargate team is being split up. I’m thinking that they gated into the middle of a simulation, mental… thing. Ha. Yeah. Reassuring to know that it’ll all be better in twenty minutes. Wish life was like that.

I think nearly everyone at school is at some level of horrible illness. Physically, I mean; it looks like everyone I’ve met so far is at least a little unstable. Humanity, I suppose.

Tension builds for the Atlantis team.

Aaand resolved. Amusing how every interaction with every new planet ends up with all future interaction with the planet being ruled out. Heh.

Anyway, goodnight.

It’s just occurred to me that I’ve been wearing headphones for the past half hour with nothing playing. … Cue Electric President. And Electric Skychurch, for the sake of efficiency. Efficiency with efficacy. I don’t know what that’s supposed to mean, but it’s alliterative and that’s really the point anyway.

Illness sweeps the campus. And, consequently, the cafe staff. Which is perfect, you know, given the amount of food and drink that we handle and distribute. There’s a little mono tossed into the viral pool, and I’m <em>really</em> hoping I don’t end up with that. Should probably be more careful who I’m making out with. &gt;_&gt;

Angst-laced jests aside, we did figure out a new way to clear out the drainage lines of the espresso machine. The solution involves some plastic tubing, a tank of compressed nitrous oxide (why we use <em>that</em> for whipping cream is beyond me) and liberal amounts of duct tape. My only regret is that the stuff isn’t easily incinerated.

Fix one computer, and they start lining up. (Even at a tech institute, which surprises me.) A guy down the hall wanted to try Ubuntu. We subsequently bricked his laptop in much the same fashion as <a href=""http://ikebowen.com/704/adventures-with-an-a200-vista-and-ubuntu"">I’d done</a> with mine. The fix should therefore have been fairly simple, having been already established. The trick: it had a sata hard drive. The XP boot disc doesn’t come with drivers for that, and the Vista dvd loads crcdisk.sys the same way that the installed os does. Surprise. The solution: <a href=""http://www.ubcd4win.com/"">ubcd4win</a>. Worked beautifully.

But yeah, I have a tablet sitting on my desk with a hd hanging out the back. It won’t get past the bios with the drive plugged in (“opop”? what?), and apparently sata drives aren’t as hot-swappable as they’re supposed to be. The difficulty with this machine is that one can’t specify that it try to boot from usb before the hard drive. The boot order can be changed, just… not that part. I don’t know why. <span class=""caps"">PXE</span> is the only thing left to try, and if that fails, it shall be declared a dead hard drive. So sorry. Next.

Aww, you can’t reset your Windows password?

<a href=""http://ikebowen.com/photog/736"">Today’s photos</a> are from a dying ventilator in this floor’s garbage room.

Therefore, if the colors attack you, I am sorry. It was not of malicious intent, and I probably meant them to be less voracious.

The tickets would have sold out with the guy right in front of me. I was prepared for this, and was already laughing at the irony when the line stopped moving.
<blockquote>Seller: “Excuse me, was he standing in front of you?”
Me: “… I think?”
Guy In Front Of Me: “Actually, I was hoping I could get three tickets.”
Seller: “Yeah, this would be the last one.”
<span class=""caps"">GIFOM</span>: “Ah. Right, thanks anyway.”</blockquote>
So it was that I ended up at the Briar Street Theatre tonight at 7:40pm, using what was almost <span class=""caps"">GIFOM</span>’s ticket. (7:00-7:15 was spent at a Corner Bakery in the loop, getting a sandwich  – which was silly, because Belmont is full of quicker places, and also because the sandwich in question was destined to fall to the floor of the Jackson Street subway.)

Now, the odds of getting the last ticket sold are not so large, considering that I had to run to an atm beforehand to scrap together the appropriate funds. Combined with that, the chances of playing a part in the Blue Man Group’s performance is probably much smaller.

The theatre was decked out in the known Blue Man fashion. Pipes and cables and flexible ventilation tubing everywhere. Spheres embedded in the walls with water being sprayed inside from who knows where, massive incandescent bulbs illuminating wire figures set into the ceiling, reaching out their hands to the concert-goers.

The auditorium itself was set with the same motif, only with industrial-class toilet paper affixed in strategic locations. (I’d have more pictures, but the show’s introduction includes an audience-given oath to not take any pictures. That, and a friendly reminder to David Glenfeld, who is a little behind on his credit card payments. Just a little.)

Anyway. Sitting in seat P-1, reading my Playbill before the show. A woman (presumably the stage manager) walks up to me and asks, “Roughly speaking, how tall are you?” Without talking about how backstage works (because that would be poor form, pretty sure), I will say that an hour and twenty minutes into the show, a fish was shown. A fish, a print made from a blue-painted fish being slapped against canvas, and a red <span class=""caps"">LED</span> sign explaining that the latter captures the life force of the fish in question (since deceased). At this point, a very bright spotlight hit seat P-1, and a surprised white male, roughly 5’11”, was duly escorted to the stage. One of the Blue Men touched his face, left a mark of blue paint before putting him into a white suit and a black motorcycle helmet, and then taking him away from the audience’s view.

A video feed, labeled ‘live from backstage’, showed this poor fellow being hung from the ceiling by his feet, painted blue, and then slapped against a canvas – presumably to capture his life force.

I’m not sure what happened next, mostly because my head was then encased in a large cone of red jello and wheeled back onstage. (The rest of my corporeal self was placed in a black wooden box beneath the head, thus sidestepping the need for a really ridiculous amount of jello.) The Blue Men tore the jello away, granting me sight, and raised my hands in triumph. Apparently the bodyprint standing next to me was just that awesome.

The rest of the show was equally incredible, if not more so for being able to see everything without looking through red gelatin. I heard someone describe the experience as ‘glorious euphoria’, and that’s probably accurate. The Blue Men proper manifested the spirit of wonder and exploration, and coupled with a slightly awkward approach and inspired aural/visual production on the part of the crew, it was… yeah. Amazing. Go see the show.

The final number was essentially a massive rave. <span class=""caps"">PVC</span>, strobe lights, black lights and the aforementioned industrial toilet paper. Streams of the stuff flying out over the audience, being carried forward to the stage by everyone present. Pipes flying in circles overhead and the Blue Men pumping music through the suddenly very living air. (Strobes + black lights = persistence of vision at its best.)

This video is from their How To Be A Megastar 2.0 tour, part of which was included in tonight’s performance. … Not this part (probably for the best; ticket prices would have been insane), but it’ll give you an idea of what I’m trying to say.

The rewrite is coming. Honest. So many hours… So much code… I’m friggen excited for the release; humor me a little while I go on a bit?

For the Textpattern developers out there, this might be of interest to you. The forthcoming release (going to call it version 4, though it’s closer to nine if we count the earlier designs) is similar to this one in that it’s an ajax frontend built onto Textpattern’s core. The difference is that, while v3 was/is essentially a hacked mashup, v4 stays very close to Textpattern’s normal operation. V3’s article list, for example, is pure <span class=""caps"">PHP</span> and mySQL. There is nothing Textpattern about it, and this lends it to vulnerabilities with article status and viewing permissions. V4, on the other hand, lets Textpattern build all of the <span class=""caps"">HTML</span> (using the actual article tags! who’d have ever thought…) before applying anything fancy schmancy over the top.

And now, a word on the interface. Ahem.

Version 4 is completely nonstandard. There are only so many permutations of the three-column layout, and versions 1-8ish pretty much exhausted my options.

The general sort of goal for v4 was a completely functional ui that’s as intuitive as possible without actually telling the user anything articulately. This means stripping out most of the usual navigation cues, and replacing them with a new system that (hopefully) will give the user a fresh experience that actually includes a little bit of exploration. … The trick, of course, is to keep the <em>required</em> element of exploration to a minimum, allowing the people who just need to <em>find</em> something to get to where they need to go quickly, but still leave in enough material for the visitor with time to burn.

When approaching a rewrite/redesign, I go through a lot of sketches. In this case, ‘sketch’ refers to a hastily-coded quasi-operational draft website. (Apparently I can code a visual faster than I can draw it. Ha.) Usually it takes six or seven new sketches before I settle on something I like, but in this case it was pretty much clear from the beginning how the site would basically look.

It was also pretty clear that such a design would take a <em>lot</em> of work. I thusly went through six or seven new sketches anyway, ignoring the nagging little voice giving me grief for being so lazy in the face of what could be a really cool concept.

Buuut, nothing worked. Resigning myself to what was obvious at the beginning (hate it when that happens), I started a fresh installation of Textpattern and began. Code ensued. Syntax errors arose, were evaluated, and were overcome. Victory is imminent.

Anyway, to sum up: this is new. Or will be. Both visually and operationally. I’m working towards the tightest integration I can between ajax and Textpattern, and I think that’s eventually going to take the form of a couple new Textpattern plugins… (Unless someone beats me to it. My blessings if it’s you.) Visually, I’m 90% sure the design will be awesome. 10%, it’ll be an awful failure and people will be confused. A grand Experiment.

.. Gah, I hope this works. (And you know what, screw you, IE. This – is – <span class=""caps"">STANDARDS</span> <span class=""caps"">COMPLIAANNNTT</span>!)

Bleary-eyed and not so bushy-tailed. Perhaps my efforts in development would be justified if I had a massive audience, but I prefer to think that the handful of you are worth the hours invested. Currently working on adding hijaxing, which is apparently the buzzword for letting you use the back/forward buttons on your browser when you move back and forth in an ajax-driven website. History + ajax = hijax. Clever. Clever, but not so simply to implement. It’s nearly finished, but isn’t quite stable enough to push online at this hour.

I come away from this evening not only with yet even more javascript, but also a firm resolve to get a cat. Two, if I can manage it. We had dinner at a friend’s apartment (dinner and the finale of Project Runway – it seems that fashion show drama makes great television), and our host had cats. It was in the hour before dinner that I realized what it had taken so long to figure out, that code is not real code unless a cat is sitting on the keyboard while you work. And if the cat in question decides to attack your coat afterwards (“blast you, it’s <em>inanimate!!</em>“), so much the better.

Milestone – first single-subject portrait shot used for a blog entry. (What, you weren’t keeping track?)

To begin with, Chicago traffic is awful. And I’m pretty sure the highway authority manipulates the gridlock to slow down whatever lane my car is in. Pretty sure.

But I’m jumping ahead. It is Tuesday. Three days ago, it was Sunday, which found the aforesaid blighted car headed up to Madison by way of I-94. (This was the first mistake, but I-90, I-94, I’m sure a lot of people screw that up.) My high school’s Academic Decathlon team had gone on to state competition again, which really was something that I couldn’t miss. Even if all of my work shifts were being covered by one person, except two. (Granted, they fired the person with those last two, but no matter.)

Good to see the team again. Decathlon was not a trivial thing in mi vida, and for anyone of you reading this, I’m proud of you all. :) You too, coach.

But that aside. Madison is cold. Noodles &amp; Co is kinda expensive, Chin’s has great wonton … things. The soap store still has that one particular unspeakably-scented fragrance (thank you for dousing me in it, Emma), and since when does Ragstock stock Aeropostle? Breakfast at Einstein’s and Starbucks (oh bliss, sweet sweet bliss, even if it is 8am), and back to Uno’s for pizza that (I think) is still in a box on the hotel room floor. Ah well. Good times.

And Otis, the kindly female elevators (referred to singly, yes – it’s kind of an elevator-hive-mind thing), is still ferrying the well and not-so-well-dressed from Parking Level A to Lobby, Bar and Restaurant, announced in dulcet tones.

<blockquote>Growing tired of bedside resolve
Public display of depression
Something’s got to give now
Something’s going to break down
I grow tired of writing songs
While people listen but never hear what’s really going on now
Tell me what’s so wrong now

<em>Clap your hands all ye children…</em>

For most who live and breathe
Hell is never knowing who they are now
Tell me who you are now
Finally safe from the outside trapped in what you know
Are you safe from yourself? Can you escape all by yourself?

<em>It’s not the lies that you sing</em>
<em>But what the silence will scream</em>

Clap your hands all ye children
<em>There’s a clamor in your whispering</em>
Clap your hands tonight
<em>Hear what the silence screams</em>
Clap your hands, clap your hands now all ye children
Clap your hands all ye children

<strong>Kurt:</strong> “One moment, I think I threw away something important. Yes…there’s a customer in the trash. Oh, bother.”
<strong>Shea:</strong> Actually, I think another customer had ordered “cafe mocha, small size.” He was just ensuring that the customer was still in the trash.

<strong>Diminutive male</strong> of unclear ethnicity with an unexpectedly high voice: Coffee.
<strong>I:</strong> Oookay, what size for you?
<strong>D:</strong> Caffasheeno.
<strong>I:</strong> Cappuccino?
<strong>D:</strong> Yes, medium.
<strong>I:</strong> Right, your total is -
<strong>D:</strong> (thrusts $20 over the counter)
<strong>I:</strong> Seventeen seventeen is your change, thank you.
<strong>D:</strong> Whah?
<strong>I:</strong> … Your change.. never mind, back counter. (points)
<strong>D:</strong> (wanders over to back counter where his caffasheeno is even now being prepared)
<strong>D:</strong> (returns, suspicious)
<strong>I:</strong> Can I help you?
<strong>D:</strong> (presents the $5 bill from his change) Can I haff another one of thees?
<strong>I:</strong> .. I’m sorry? (thinks: if he’s asking me for money, I swear…)
<strong>D:</strong> Thees one… (points at the bill, which is apparently beyond his tolerance level for wear and tear)
<strong>I:</strong> Ah, right. Sure. (takes the bill, fetches a replacement)
<strong>D:</strong> Thank! (mollified)

<strong>and now, our feature presentation</strong>

I have concluded that the Asian population at <span class=""caps"">IIT</span> functions in a way not dissimilar to the Borg hive mind, at least inasmuch as it pertains to food and drink. You may take as evidence their uncanny ability to suddenly descend (ascend?) upon the cafe in hordes, and then all – individually – order mochas. Or, rather, “cafe mocha – small size”. It wasn’t always like this (my theory is that the mind is reformed annually), but one day one of them discovered the mocha, and it became universal. Further evidence is the mocha (mocha!) freeze, a sort of a chocolate blended ice drink. One day, a rogue Asian deviated from the normal order. Apparently he was not so far out of the neural loop to keep this from the rest of collective, for the mocha freeze is now a hive favorite.

But it can’t touch the cafe mocha.

Now, this particular order gets on my nerves to begin with. It’s like the default drink. If someone doesn’t know what to order, they get a mocha. Some of them seem to think that it <em>is</em> the basic espresso drink – one customer wondered, when informed that we were out of mocha chocolate, if we therefore couldn’t serve <em>anything</em> on the menu.

But it’s markedly worse with the international population. Actually, I’m pretty sure that it’s what they tell them at customs. “You may get coffee while in the US. But only the mocha. Or you will be deported. We swear.”

Perhaps the single most irritating manifestation of this instance, however, occurs when a single, tiny Asian female approaches the counter, and makes the typical order. Cafe mocha, small size. … I have nothing against tiny people. Or Asians. Or females. Honest. It’s just so – fricking – irritating.

Song of the moment: Here We are, by Breaking Benjamin. Playlist is just a lot of decent albums thrown together. But I think that Zune’s shuffle is more intelligent than it lets on – it consistently manages to arrange the music into a contiguous-by-mood order. Which is strange – I have everything from Linkin Park to The Postal Service in here, and it’s all been quiet and grey thus far.

<a href=""http://www.purevolume.com/callmeconstant"">Call Me Constant</a> played at the Bog tonight. (The Bog, for the uninitiated, is sort of an underground pub on campus. With a couple lanes of bowling, a couple 360’s and a Wii.) They were good, actually. Purevolume classifies them as indie/rock/progressive (nvm, Zune just played The Missing Frame), so if you like that sort of thing – Cartel, The Academy Is…, a touch (a small touch) of Modest Mouse… yeah. They’re releasing an actual album in the near future, but there’s a recordedinthebasement demo online if you’re curious.

Moral of the story: don’t give the Chinese delivery guys a phone number with call screening attached. When they hear a nice, generic female voice ask for their name, they hang up. It’s true. And then they yell at you for having a broken phone, and you feel obligated to tip them extra for suffering so.

Also, the fortunes I’ve been getting (the little cookie/paper ones, but if you have any of the more expensive sort, I’m still accepting cash donations) have become targeted. Specifically targeted, as in they’ve managed to all be about the same thing over a four week span.
<blockquote>Your financial situation will be improving shortly.

You will do better in real estate than in stocks.

The stock market may be your ticket to success.</blockquote>
Apparently the stock market = win, and real estate = extra win (thank you, Cory). Also, Facebook has spoken – I ‘can drink more’ than [name removed].

The Chinese was precluded by an attempt to pay our rent. Rent and security deposit, which was unexpected and bit unexpectedly deeply into my checkbook. Collegiate life, Isaac. Our landlord (who looks like a mafia boss, honestly) runs a chain of restaurants (pancake houses, which is interesting), and asked us to drop off the checks at the one on Lakeshore Drive. He would then buy us dinner (pancakes!), which made using Jeff’s car worth the apparent risk.

Jeff’s car, see, is dying. (Or has died, actually, but as of that time – two days ago – it was still limping tolerably.) It’s a 1986 two-door convertible, and the interior is completely stripped out. Still don’t know why, but no matter. The point is moot, as it has since collided unhappily with another, younger, vehicle. And promptly retired without much complaint.

But I digress; it was still working. And continued to work properly, up until a little past Navy Pier. This was when things went a little awry, and smoke began billowing (billowing, yes) out from the hood. I’m told that this happens sometimes, but as long as air keeps moving through the thing it doesn’t overheat. The trouble, then, was that we elected to travel on Lakeshore, which according to <span class=""caps"">WXRT</span> had the worst traffic in Chicago at that time.

The natural course of action cannot, I think, be debated. We waited for the gridlock to inch us along to the next exit, and then parked in front (in <em>front</em>) of the nearest high-class loft complex we could find.

The concierge was concerned.

And rightly so, what with the antifreeze flowing smoothly into the street.

The rest of the story isn’t nearly as exciting – the car cooled down eventually, and Jeff keeps a couple gallons of water and extra antifreeze in the trunk for this sort of scenario. Made it safely back to school. Missed out on the pancakes.

Cable/internet is ordered, and apparently we’re in apartment 3F, rather than simply 4. Also, coincidentally, 302 W 31st is also an apartment building – the upshot of which is that you can mistakenly give Comcast this address and there will be zero warning signs. Except that they also do not have an apartment 4.

The Rhinelander school system reports a now-excused absence from the last half of the day for one Isaac Bowen, senior.

——

It’s 10:27, but the tablet clock says past midnight. Like my watch and the long-dead wooden clock in the corner, it’s wrong.

I called it a day hours ago, opting for a book and music in my room to anything else. I’m reading The Rule of Four – fantastic book. Intelligent, yet engaging. A quote:
<blockquote>Hope, … which whispered from Pandora’s box only after all the other plagues and sorrows, is the best and last of all things. Without it, there is only time. And time pushes at our backs like a centrifuge, forcing us outward and away, until it nudges us into oblivion. … It’s a law of motion, a fact of physics … , no different from the stages of white dwarfs and red giants. Like all things in the universe, we are destined from birth to diverge. Time is simply the yardstick of our separation. If we are particles in a sea of distance, exploded from an original whole, then there is a science to our solitude. We are lonely in proportion to our years.</blockquote>
Hope. Ask me at any other time, and I’d put it on the level with love, “the quintessential human delusion”.

——

It was cleared with a parent phone call, along with the morning absence on Thursday (appointment at Ministry Behavioral Health).

——

But now… [sighs] <em>another place without an ending</em> and all that. Iris. Good guys.

I’ve been diagnosed with clinical depression. If you know me at all (or have been reading this blog…), that won’t be a shocker. There’s even a family history to go with it. My parents, interestingly, think it’s a something of symptom, not entirely an independent… disease.

At some level, I agree with them. While depression is a disorder in its own right, I think it’s brought on / encouraged by a deliberately withdrawn and closed mentality, more often than not. When I say that my world is bleak, I’m referring to “my world”. Depression takes a guy and twists him back around and into himself – a cycle, if you will, where the only new sight is the footsteps you left behind the last time around. A sad, quiet circle, traced by a soul oddly fascinated by its own decay.

A selfish thing, in essence, much as I hate to say that, born of an extended look in the mirror and an abandonment of everything else. Tends to escalate, too.

“Everything else” here defined as hope, love, God. And I rather think that this is why depression is as widespread as it is – not just the diagnosed incidents, but the Prozac Nation mentality as a whole. Society <em>encourages</em> a focus on oneself, from spas to self-help books. And when your view of yourself obstructs everything else, then <em>yes</em> the outlook is bleak. There <em>is nothing</em> for the solitary human.

Which is the conclusion that, at the great age of 18, I have come to. It makes sense, chemical imbalance or no, natural tendency or otherwise.

So – how to get out of it. The meds should help. Improve my exercise regime, try to get out more. Try to get my focus off of me and back on God, trite as that might sound.

Did you need to know all of this? Probably not, loyal reader, but you now know anyway.

<strong>afterthought</strong>

It’s… hard. To want to be “fixed”. I said this earlier in another section, but having a more positive personality just sounds… tiring. You can’t convince a depressed person that life should be enjoyed. It’ll make sense, and said person will be able to see that life <em>can</em> be enjoyed, but no worthwhile purpose will be obvious. Or, well, going on my case. Not sure why I felt like adding this, but there y’are.

This is also the last week of regular classes, which is better for everyone who can think more than two weeks in advance, but probably worse for the majority that doesn’t have enough time to finish everything before finals. Still though, it’s nice to have an actual date to look forward to when one expects certain doom, rather than being perpetually on tenterhooks, waiting for scholastic armageddon.

That said, things are sort of piling up, stacking up for a final peak of overall pressure before everything releases again for the summer. My siblings in Germany are counting down the days before we see each other again, and I think that’s what’s keeping me sane just now.

Located right about <a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=41.924149,-87.69741&amp;panoid=g3QSAZCX8wWdqiALaChNUw&amp;cbp=1,415.34620221922313,,0,7.775167151386121&amp;ll=41.926133,-87.698332&amp;spn=0.004103,0.01354&amp;z=17"">here</a>, roughly at 2352 N California Ave. Just lying on the ground, sadly flashing the little red light of expired parking. We propped it up on the way there, <a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=41.923862,-87.697281&amp;panoid=FpGz2CzYmX1svgL7V4b1yQ&amp;cbp=1,20.35820495891852,,0,6.648876336697122&amp;ll=41.924375,-87.697259&amp;spn=0.001026,0.002505&amp;z=19"">next to a fire hydrant</a> that had been left open – a temporary monument to public service at its best.

Thing is, it was still there when we walked by on the way back. Blinking.

Now, in our defence, street signs and parking meters have a degree of novelty about them. It <em>would</em> have been perfect in someone’s apartment.

So, there we are. Or rather, there I am, carrying this parking meter, wearing a black trench coat. And the thing’s heavy, right. We weren’t sure how much change was in it (“oh… we’ll have to go around putting it into other meters if we ever get it out, I guess… or we can just leave it in there”), but yeah. Heavy. One of my companions suggested covering the top of the meter with my sweater (also black, ha). The purpose of this was to keep passersby from stopping us, I think, though in retrospect there are few ways to conceal a parking meter on one’s person. The sweater didn’t go very far in that regard.

Stopped for a couple minutes at the corner of <a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ll=41.923538,-87.697361&amp;spn=0.001026,0.003385&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=41.923026,-87.697383&amp;panoid=c5uJFhsYqcNERO2FbtxsPA&amp;cbp=1,91.81980293639879,,0,4.304498580532777"">California and Milwaukee</a>, waiting for a companion to check a store down the street. This turned out to be a bad move. The first cruiser didn’t really do anything, just drove past. Keep breathing. The next four cruisers instead surrounded the street corner, which was actually a little alarming.

An undercover cop walked up and took the meter, looked incredulously at the sweater and returned it to me after clearly indicating what he thought of my sanity. One of the others cuffed me, pushed me against the squad car after ensuring that the two companions weren’t really with me and could take all of my possessions (this was convenient, he said, as it cut down on processing time at the station). And yeah, zero Miranda rights.

One of the lackeys drove me to the station. “Dude, you can’t just walk off with something like that. It’s city property, dog. Look, here’s the call-in -”, which went to the effect of “<span class=""caps"">MALE</span> <span class=""caps"">CAUCASIAN</span>, <span class=""caps"">WEARING</span> <span class=""caps"">ALL</span> <span class=""caps"">BLACK</span>, <span class=""caps"">TWO</span> <span class=""caps"">WHITE</span> <span class=""caps"">FEMALE</span> <span class=""caps"">COMPANIONS</span>, <span class=""caps"">THEFT</span> IN <span class=""caps"">PROGRESS</span>”. This seems a little like overkill, given that it really only amounted to three white collegiates carrying a parking meter down the street. <em>Four</em> cruisers?

After carefully noting my street address, ssn and checking my belt, shoelaces and Zune into police inventory back at the station, they sent me off to the precinct holding cells. This was precluded by taking my prints and mugshot (which I haven’t yet been able to get a copy of).

I spent a total of three and a half hours in there. In absolute terms, this wasn’t bad. The fellow in the cell on the left was in there overnight, freaking out about his girlfriend’s domestic abuse charges. But with no way to measure time and no one within my line of sight, it was a little unsettling. Though it’s true, hearing the other detainees going on did prove interesting. The guys a couple cells down on the right were in for heroin use, though the one swore to the officer that he didn’t remember any of it, being thoroughly inebriated at the time. It was unclear what his cellmate was swearing, or to whom, but he was adamant that he had, in fact, died, and he wasn’t completely clear on how the emergency personnel had gotten around that.

They let me out around 4:30, I think. Gave me an I-Bond (a picture is a thousand words, apparently a criminal’s signature is a thousand dollars), assigned a court date, granted me my shoelaces and other paraphernalia, and sent me on my way. The problem was, of course, getting in contact with my co-conspirators and then getting on the train, neither having my phone nor my wallet. The 53 cents I had connected me to someone completely random on the payphone, but thank heaven for compassionate pedestrians who give money to haggard-looking white students.

The best part is that I still managed to make it to that evening’s Skillet concert at House of Blues with my flatmate.

I basically tried to ignore the whole thing from that point on, and managed to do so tolerably well after sleeping for fifteen hours thereafter.

The legal spam brought it back to my attention a couple weeks ago. Multiple letters from Chicago attorneys, offering their eighty seven thousand ish years of experience in exactly your sort of criminal situation.

This is running long, so in brief – I did end up calling a private attorney, initially solely for advice with zero intent to hire. Hired him anyway, dipping waay down into what assets this student has left, mostly because I didn’t have a clue how criminal hearings work or what to expect on the other side of the courtroom bench, given that I was to leave the country directly after the semester. It was reassuring to finally hear answers from a professional.

May 9th sentence: three months court supervision with a court fee to boot. My alternative was twenty hours community service, with charges dropped. As it stands, I can’t get this expunged from my record for five years after the end of supervision, but that’s not too horrible. Potential employers: I’m not a criminal, just an idiot.

To that end, my car was double-ticketed this morning. Once for being in the wrong place at the wrong time for street cleaning, and once for expired plates.

The renewal stickers were already delivered, actually. But I think they’re in Germany.",exigraff wp_posts.csv

Sunset photos are overrated. But the drive north was unreasonably stunning, to the point of being hazardous. That said, if the driver of a blue Mazda headed north on I90 at about 6pm happens to be reading this, I apologize for putting you into undue peril. Unless you deserved it. In which case, I got the photo I wanted, and you had it coming anyway.

I’m home, anyway. Sort of. Back in Rhinelander. My home is currently in Germany, but my job is here, and I just realized that those are horrible priorities but that’s generally how America gets by so I expect I’ll live.

Notes from the trip: raced a semi out of downtown Chicago at about 15mph. (I won, by a good yard or so.) Encountered a military convoy around nine, slowed back down to the speed limit. I doubt that the army cares much how fast I’m driving, but I think they have guns.

I also think the state trooper on highway 51 had a gun, but it was too dark to tell for sure. It’s irregular for a trooper to pull over someone going anything less than 10mph over, but the missing headlamp probably had something to do with it.

My sister’s voice is all but dead. She blames an alleged sinus infection. This is impeccable timing for scholarship night (graduates of Rhinelander High will remember this particular tribulation), and only slightly less so for the flight to Berlin on Tuesday.

Tuesday. We’re going home. It’s been far too long, and no matter how many times you see them online, it’s still going to be weird when Little Brother is taller than Mom.

I am here. This is day one. Assuming one includes yesterday, which probably isn’t fair. But I had a photo for day one (as pictured), and skipping to day two would have been bad form.

United 7200, from Wausau to Chicago. No problems.  A woman named Suzanne was horribly late for United 940, from Chicago to Frankfurt. I think we eventually left without her, roughly an hour off schedule. This meant that we were also late arriving in Frankfurt, which was probably why they dumped us on the tarmac and sent us up four flights of service stairs, rather than bothering with the whole boarding platform thing.

Suzanne knew not what she had done, but the pilot on Lufthansa 178 (Berlin-bound) seemed a little annoyed with the deluge of late American passengers. That said, Lufthansa is such a better airline…

Actually, European stuff as a whole seems to be better (read: more practical) than American.. stuff. Down to the way their doorframes and dumpsters are made. (Which, by the way, should be a band – Doorframes and Dumpsters. Knocks Angels and Airwaves out of the water.)

More later, perhaps. I’m not dealing with the time change terribly well (slept until 4pm today), but apparently it takes a week to get that under control.

It’s 10:30pm, and it’s clear that my body doesn’t really know what to think at this point.

Rostock today. Subway, McDonalds, even TK-Maxx. I learned how to buy coffee, and how to apologize to people in the grocery store when being inadvertently stupid and American. And somehow there’s an espresso machine in the flat now, but we’re lacking any sort of tamp. Little frustrated there.

The trouble with any sort of travel is.. well. There’s always so many ways to look at so many things. I cite <a href=""http://exigraff.com/blog/626/shadow-of-the-day"">an earlier entry</a> for this; stopping at any given point in time (while being free to move about myself, which is what, adding on another dimension?

However, it would mean an overwhelming amount of takes to step through when it’s all over. I can’t handle this sort of volume as it is. :)",exigraff wp_posts.csv

Church today. The people there were friendly, more gregarious than any I’ve seen since coming here. I suppose that’s not saying much, as East Germans are very reserved as a rule, but the ones here did go in for the whole hand shaking thing. I understood perhaps 3% of the sermon, but came away with the feeling that one would pick it up more of it eventually. This feeling may have been completely unfounded, as my brothers assure me that they have <em>been</em> through that ‘eventually’ and have made little progress thus far.

Which is ridiculous; they’re doing remarkably well. Immersion ftw.

Visited a family from the church for a few hours, following a walk in the park (more like a wood that happened to have suitable walking paths, actually). The husband is a programmer for a software consulting firm, his wife teaches piano within their home and at a localish music academy. The dog doesn’t do anything in particular, but is instead named Isha (aye-shah), which they figure mostly makes up for it.

Their (primary) piano (among three) was of interest. Scarcely two weeks old. Understand that I haven’t touched a piano – any piano – for months, let alone a shining black stallion of a piano. It wasn’t anything terribly fancy, just an upright (though it did have the ability to silence the strings and turn into what amounts to a hammer-action digital), but.. sigh. Like picking up an old drug habit.

I would think.

And I love old churches, by the way. There are a couple shots in <a href=""http://isaacbowen.com/photog"">photog</a> of one from a few days ago; you can see graffiti on the walls in a few takes. We went to one this evening for a concert – absolutely massive cathedral. A work of art. In complete awe the entire time. Pictures tomorrow, but… man. Beautiful. The concert was the church choir and philharmonic orchestra (oh yes, they have their own philharmonic), and between their skill (impressive for what was essentially a group of parishioners) and the acoustics (imagine masonry walls holding vaulted ceilings three hundred feet high)… yeah. Beautiful. The concert also included a performance on the church organ, the pipes for which took up most of one wall. Absolutely incredible.

Though the best part was probably the Bose speakers mounted on the austere stone walls. :D The building was in the final half of restoration (the concert was part of a fundraiser, I think), and the construction scaffolding in parts of the halls made for an interesting juxtaposition with the aging majesty of the cathedral itself.

But yeah. Pictures tomorrow.

(Picture unrelated.)

I’ll need to see this animated/rendered someday. If you’re more comfortable in Maya than in shoes, have at it. Or I’ll get around to it eventually.

The following is not in widescreen. It’s in regular 4:3, and I don’t know why. Just is. The backdrop is off-white but not much so, just a very little cream in there. There’s a hemisphere of water in the center of the initial field of vision, like a glass sphere’s been half filled, except there’s no actual glass sphere. If there were, it’d be thirty or forty feet across. Very slight breeze, enough to keep the water in a little bit of motion.

There are some rules to the camera, the point of view. As long as there is no motion, time/physics moves forward at the normal rate and everything remains in color. As soon as the camera moves or the angle changes, everything stops and the view goes into exaggerated monochrome. Exaggerated, meaning heightened shadows and lights.

There’s probably a soundtrack to this. The entire sequence is probably five minutes. Maybe it’s a music video.

Watching the water, directly ahead, maybe a hundred or so feet away. The camera remains motionless, and after a few seconds, the birds begin. They’re relatively generic birds, but they are blood red in their entirety – feathers and claws and eyes. They fly alone, across the viewframe from right to left, in straight lines. They do not fly within the glass sphere that does not exist, and there aren’t particularly many of them. Just a red bird, here and there, flying through.

After two or three leave the frame off to the left, the camera angles up a little and zooms in to view one of the birds up close. The bird accordingly freezes in the air while this motion takes place, and the world goes black and white. You can see from a decreasing distance that the bird is losing definition, and as the camera approaches, it becomes evident that the mass of the bird is liquefying from the outside in. The core mass hangs in the air, but as the dark grey feathers and wings and body take on the consistency of thick ink, it falls in slow motion out of the sky. This is happening off in the distance as well, out of focus. One or two others. The camera stops near the bird, and as it does, the color leaps back into place. Raining red.

Camera cuts to another angle of the water, similarish to the initial view. Watching them fly past, watching the water. With no visual warning, something falls from above the viewframe and hits the water – as the camera starts a gradual zoom, the action slows to a standstill. In the middle of the crater-shaped splash, you can tell that it’s a human, nude, in the fetal position (cannon-ball?). White hair, long-ish, probably male. Caucasian.

Camera moves quickly back to the original view. The human loses the momentum of the fall and sinks to the bottom of the water, but doesn’t fall out of the non-existent glass sphere. Just sits there, curled up.

Birds keep flying. Only one or two at a time.

(I’m not entirely sure how the camera angle is handled from this point on; it’s different in my mind each time.)

The human awakens. His eyes are white, no pupils. Pushes off of the bottom of the water with his feet and flies up, straightening up as he goes, erupts from the surface. Maybe five feet up from the water, he casts his arms out wide, angled slightly up, throws his head back and screams. Silently, not a sound. At this point, with water’s splash suspended in the air from his emergence and with the human in the center, everything freezes, goes black and white. (This would require camera motion, I suppose.) And he, like the out-of-focus birds in the background, begins to melt in slow motion. Only difference: the human melts into black. And just as he becomes completely black (this is literal liquid black), and begins to lose recognizable definition, physics resume. Thick black rain, into the water below. It doesn’t mix, but you can see it spreading.

Back to the original point of view. Watching the birds, and the now-blackening water.

There are a couple inconsistencies to this sequence, yes. First and foremost is the fact that, while time is ostensibly stopped, the “melting” carries on anyway in slow motion. Yep. Additionally, there are going to have to be a couple gradual movements of the camera that happen while time continues merrily on. This is contradictory to the aforementioned motion/time rules, so perhaps they need to be tweaked a bit. And a performance note: the human is always facing the right (e.g. not the way the birds are facing), his back to the left.

Anyway. This sequence brought itself into being on the train today, coming back to Rostock from Berlin. Listening to <span class=""caps"">MCR</span>, half-sleeping. It started out taking place in a lake, surrounded by grass and trees and such. Blue sky, all that. Ended up considerably more minimal/surrealistic by the time the train hit Rostock. It’s all very clear in my mind, and I think I’ve got it written up as best I can. You can probably assume that it’s cooler than it reads; I was never very good at describing what goes through my head. However, my memory being what it is, this is more for my reference than for your entertainment anyway. Take that.

That said, make what you will of it. I’m going to have to draw/storyboard this out at some point, might post the sketches if/when I do. If you have mad 3d skills (like, crazy-mad), let me know. Be aware ahead of time that I am nearly broke just now.

Friiiiiday.

I’m back in the States, finally getting around to the various and sundry details that I knew would have to be dealt with a month ago but waited until now to mess with. Namely, the sorting/editing of 2000+ photos from Germany, switching majors, finding a new phone, paying bills, and starting work. In order of importance.

And internet. The house I’m staying won’t have broadband until Wednesday, which is why I’ve started spending three or four hours daily at a cafe in town. Nice enough place. They have a new espresso machine, three heads and something or other that warrants a digital display. Couldn’t see it well enough. Beautiful stuff though.

Mostly cloudy, 74 degrees fahrenheit. Germany got really hot towards the end, upwards of 35 centigrade. Family’s loving it; the winter months were all dreary and wet. Which I love, yeah, but them, not so much. :) They have another two months there, I think. Something like a July 31st flight back to O’Hare.

And <a href=""http://anthonyrhook.com"">Anthony</a> has a 12” sub in his car now. Woo. Went out for a drive last night in the storm, trying to follow fire engines and cop cars through the lightning. He’ll go deaf like that, pretty sure, but it’ll be completely worth it.

I have a clear head. I think.

Honest, this is remarkable. I’m completely awake. Arguably a little more than awake when you count the caffeine intake.

I’ve been waking up before eight am for the last few days, which seems to be a side effect of travelling west. Have given up fighting that, largely because it’ll come in handy when work starts this week. I actually started working out this morning at six, probably for the first time in years. Felt good.

And listening to Hybrid Theory. Over and over and over again.

… Nothing really to say here, not a whole lot remarkable. I have a <a href=""http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=260248130402"">new phone</a> coming in, I still owe a lot of people a lot of money, internet comes on the eleventh, my incomplete is almost cleared away, work starts Monday… yep. Nothing further.

<p>Tired and sore. I&#8217;ve resolved to be getting up at 5:30am daily, to give time for a morning workout and all before work at 7:30. I&#8217;m not even sure what the actual hours are for the staff here (probably knew at one point; this is my third summer here), but it&#8217;s looking like 47.5 hrs/wk minimum from the start.</p>

<p>They&#8217;re looping a George Winston cd in the hallway, I think. They made such a big deal last year out of copyright laws for commercial music, but apparently they&#8217;re past that now.</p>

<p>The general idea with the exercise is to lessen the depression a little. Not sure how much an effect it&#8217;ll have, but I could use the training anyway.</p>

<p>The lethargy stage is setting in.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not slobbish lethargy, like you&#8217;re lazy or anything. You just don&#8217;t want to&#8230; move. Partly because there&#8217;s nothing sufficiently desirable to move <em>towards</em>, partly because.. idk. I guess that&#8217;s it. There&#8217;s nothing that seems worth the movement it would take to achieve it.</p>

<p>Made it through Monday #1. Possibly only because I left early, but what have you.</p>

<p>It just occurred to me that this town will not serve as a home base for my peers much longer. And that, while I&#8217;m going to Chicago, my best friend is going in the opposite direction. Almost as far. Yeah, distance is relative and means virtually nothing in this grand exalted age. But this bothers me somewhat more than I expected.</p>

<p>Best friend. There&#8217;s a title. I think your romantically-significant-other is supposed to take that spot when they show up. I don&#8217;t think mine did, when she was there. Or maybe, I&#8217;m not sure. I&#8217;m still not sure about that particular debacle.</p>

<p>I tend to keep the people I care about most at a carefully judged distance. Far enough that I won&#8217;t get blood on them, for example. Though part of it is definitely being scared to death that they&#8217;ll stop caring if they get close enough to see who/what this person actually is.</p>

<p>Which is foolish, of course. A lot of unnecessary pain. Probably on both ends; I can&#8217;t always tell how badly (or if at all) the other party is affected&#8230; but this is simply what I do. Every time. Back away slowly, watching for their expressions, when I only want them to hold me close, tell me that (honestly) it&#8217;s not as bad as you think &#8211; and I will never let go.</p>

<p>That has yet to happen. Like actually, physically, happen, significant other or whoever, and yes, there is a difference. I sort of doubt it ever really will. Not if I have anything to do with it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m getting quasi-emotional in a public library. Really, I have awful timing.</p>

<p><strong>part two</strong></p>

<p>Acknowledging that depression is a disorder invalidates all of the emotions it causes.</p>

<p>That sucks.</p>

<p>Granted, the brain is a machine. And if it&#8217;s built differently, it will operate differently.</p>

<p>&#8230; The rest of that paragraph was going to be an argument invalidating emotion on a larger scale, and thereby making some desperate attempt to validate the depressive stuff on the grounds that it&#8217;s equally as unfounded as anything else. While throwing in some physiological crap about the hippocampus &#8211; neurons = depression and the <span class=""caps"">NGF</span> beta polypeptide that might sound sufficiently impressive to convince you that, possibly, I had some sort of point after all.</p>

<p>Fuck, I can&#8217;t even choose sides when talking to nobody about this.</p>

<p>The hell.</p>

<p><strong>part three</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to read this in five years. And I won&#8217;t be able to believe that I was throwing these words around and giving any weight to them. Then, I&#8217;ll ask myself why, if emotion is such a temporal thing, couldn&#8217;t I have simply kicked the problem and gone on with life to begin with.</p>

<p>To which I will have no reply, but will only hope that I didn&#8217;t alienate too many people in the process. &gt;_&gt;</p>

<p>(Which will lead to more stuff about how, if they were alienated by who I was, were they mine to begin with? Which is, yeah, assuming that I manage to find out what sort of person I was supposed to be without this colloquial cloud over my head.)</p>

<p><strong>part four</strong></p>

<p>You&#8217;ll excuse me if I go off and scream for a while, won&#8217;t you?</p>

<p>Splendid, because it looks like that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening. I&#8217;ll be done soon.</p>

2008-06-10 21:14:42,To Fly,"<img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/128.jpg"" alt="""" />

I used to dream. I still do, but there was one dream from years ago that I’d have, over and over again. The same dream, slight differences, would appear so very often.

It was about flying, which I suppose isn’t so very uncommon. People have been preoccupied with flight since 4000 BC, just to make up a date, and while it’s become slightly less fascinating, the sight of a hawk wheeling around in the sky, riding the currents, still captivates.

But anyway. A dream about flying.

In the little world that I found myself in, people could fly. Just <em>fly</em> – up and go for the heck of it. I’d stand on the sidewalk, watching the neighbors go past in whatever mode of travel pleased them at the moment.

I’d have my friends by me, or I was by them, one of the two. They’d regularly decide to go off somewhere, and at once the group would run out onto the street and, with that start, take off.

Trying to be caught up in that moment, I’d run with them. Run – go. Don’t think – run. Feel yourself rising – you <em>are</em>, you <em>are</em> – <em>go</em>.

They would fly. I’d see them, watch their faces feeling the wind as they spun and rose higher.

But the view from the ground would always leave something to be desired. For the life of me, I’d never be able to join them. Trying not to think, to just <em>fly</em>, I would always fail. Jump, and think for a moment that I’d finally broken through. That’d I’d achieved what the rest of them had accomplished with a joyful abandon.

And a second later, my feet would find the ground. There they’d go, off to who knows where. One might look back for a moment and wonder why I had stayed behind. “Come on!”

I wanted to. I still want to.

Cetera desunt and all that. Those dreams are over; haven’t had them in years. But I remember the feeling, watching them fly.",exigraff wp_posts.csv

<p>I live on systems. Knowing exactly how everything works and how it&#8217;s structured. Being able to know the reactions of a system with any given stimulus.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s why I play the piano. It&#8217;s a system. And once you become familiar with it, the theory behind it stops being important. You don&#8217;t have to think about fingers and keys and names of chords, because you&#8217;ve learned &#8211; assimilated &#8211; the system. Once you understand why the rules are what they are, you can go beyond them. And at that point, the musick can begin to flow.</p>

<p>Everything has a system. Friends, work, money. Religion. You are (I am, we are) a system as well. You can write rules that describe how you function, but you don&#8217;t function by rules &#8211; all of your interconnected parts together form themes, patterns.</p>

<p>And when one of the patterns change, everything changes. The entire system is altered, and it takes time for you to fully understand what you have become.</p>

<p>My friend is getting married tomorrow. Or today, as of seven minutes from now. Five Mt Dews, and I&#8217;m falling asleep.</p>

<p>So very .. happy? for her. She&#8217;s gone and found the person that apparently is meant for her. And vice versa. And I fully expect them to spend the rest of their lives together. Couldn&#8217;t be more pleased.</p>

<p>I forgot to start taking the meds this week, in preparation for this event. I&#8217;m therefore not sure how I&#8217;m going to handle tomorrow. I play the prelude for the ceremony (approximates the live recording of Sun by Mae), which isn&#8217;t too much of a concern. Though I wrote music with this girl for three years, and would have liked to bring her something more&#8230; creative? Something more than just regurgitating what some other band did. But it was her request, and there wasn&#8217;t time for anything else. I&#8217;ll write her something better someday.</p>

<p>Tangent, sorry. Topic: I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m going to handle this. If personal history is any indicator, I&#8217;ll leave the wedding feeling completely hollow. I hesitate to use the word &#8216;anguished&#8217;, but it&#8217;s rather like that. I got a hint of that feeling today after the rehearsal. It&#8217;s like&#8230; I&#8217;m completely happy for her, for both of them. But I&#8217;m incapable of feeling it. If that makes sense.</p>

<p>Mourning. Sort of. It feels like you&#8217;re watching something beautiful come into its own, and then&#8230; well, die. Slowly. This sounds pathetic, I know, but that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s like. The wedding will be beautiful. The bride will be radiant, the groom.. will also be radiant, I suppose, but I don&#8217;t actually know the guy. They will be perfect, together. Coming alive.</p>

<p>But I can&#8217;t see life without knowing that its decay is inevitable. And the feeling of knowing that something so perfect cannot last, and will, with time (time), break apart and cease to be&#8230; it hurts. More than anything.</p>

<p>(Then you get to remember that your brain is chemically screwed, and everyone else in the church is ecstatic.)</p>

<p><em>I&#8217;ll be fine, I swear<br />
I&#8217;m just gone beyond repair</em></p>

<p>P.S. I realize this wedding isn&#8217;t about me. Obviously. And that I shouldn&#8217;t be so focused on how <em>I&#8217;m</em> going to handle it. It&#8217;s about <em>them</em>. But as a old friend of the bride, I feel like I have some sort of responsibility to not be a downer at her wedding.</p>

<p>P.P.S. I&#8217;m going to be single for basically forever, or until I get my head fixed somehow. I can&#8217;t see anyone living with this. I killed the last person who tried. And there&#8217;s no way I would let anyone that I wanted to protect anywhere near this part of me again. (This is one reason why the few close friends that I <em>do</em> have mean so very, very much to me.)</p>",whitefacade textpattern.csv
2008-06-15 08:24:43,,"<p><txp:image id=""9"" /> The actual ceremony went well. Very well. My phone decided to suddenly become fifteen minutes slow, but I did actually make it to the church on time for the prelude. Musick for the bride.</p>

<p>And they were beautiful. And I was happy for them. Genuinely and completely happy, which was something of a surprise.</p>

<p>Reception was more on target. The dance, specifically. Or thereabouts. I&#8217;m not sure. Watching the dances, the bride/groom and the father/daughter and the mother/son. Little more of the familiar reaction there.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t dance anymore.</p>

<p>Spent most of the day at a friend&#8217;s house; he happens to live directly across the highway from the church, at present. Played cards with him, his gf, gf&#8217;s sister. And suchwhat. I do enjoy hanging out with them.</p>

<p>But the drive back tonight&#8230;</p>

<p>I hold back most of my emotions. Keep them hidden, unless I&#8217;m with a select few. This typically works well enough. But every so often, every few months, everything comes out at once. I should have seen it coming, really. I can&#8217;t spend the day watching various people be happy together and come off feeling alright. I can&#8217;t. And driving back tonight on a dark highway, the musick pounding and I&#8217;m screaming the words.. yeah.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been doing that a lot, actually. On the way to and back from work and such. My voice has been pretty much shot, probably will be for the rest of the summer.</p>

<p>But when I&#8217;m like that&#8230; alone and falling to pieces on the highway.. bleh. It typically goes in stages. First few minutes are loud. Quite loud, actually. Over-agitated. The music selection reflects that, doesn&#8217;t help to fix it much, but then, that&#8217;s not why I have it. Then, suddenly, still. I catch myself not breathing, more often than not. It&#8217;s not consciously holding my breath. The whole inhale/exhale thing just stops being important for a while. This generally coincides with the car slowing waay down, and the cars behind me getting irritated and passing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not suicidal. Been there, and I may be again. But at times like tonight, I frankly just want to slam the gas pedal and throw the car straight off the road. Not because I want to die, not at all. It&#8217;d be like punching a wall. Only, more like punching a tree. With a sedan.</p>

<p>However, walls are more easily repaired than bodies and cars. And my family doesn&#8217;t need to deal with me being hospitalized. As much fun as that sounds.</p>",whitefacade textpattern.csv

<p>I wrote that on the 27th of April, 2008. A year and some months ago. Man, just a <em>year</em>&#8230; My inability to stay consistent bothers me. A year is not a long time. But&#8230; so much has changed since then&#8230;</p>

<p>Or maybe not. I have the same job. Same&#8230; mind. Maybe it&#8217;s that a year has swung me through so much <em>other</em>, and now I&#8217;m just.. back. In the same old ruts. Watching the same people do the same stuff. Reacting exactly as I did before.</p>

<p>Yeah. That sounds closer.</p>

<p>Hang on. That can&#8217;t be right.</p>

<p>A comment was entered on 01 Apr 2007. So it must have been around then. Presumably before. Still a year ago. Apparently my brain thinks 2008 was last year.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve developed a curious predilection for painting out eyes. Black or white, depending. Which would be significantly easier if I had a tablet; it&#8217;s sort of difficult to get the shading right with a laptop touchpad, make the new eye look relatively plausible.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s an area in the basement of this building that appears to have gone unnoticed during the remodeling. Used to be a kitchen, I think. A sink is still attached to one wall, developing little colonies of lordknowswhat. Should take a camera down there at some point.</p>

<p>I walked down there the other day, got up from my desk and made my way to the basement. Proceeded to punch the walls. Concrete, painted over.</p>

<p>My mind sort of splits in half when I do something like that. One half is responsible for the actual actions, throwing my fist against the wall. It&#8217;s of the opinion that I am afraid of pain, and that needs to change. It gets fairly disgusted when the other half tries to pull my hand back.</p>

<p>The whole process is remarkably rational. Walk down two floors, hit a wall to the point where it doesn&#8217;t make a bloody mess and doesn&#8217;t break anything, walk back up, enter and lock the bathroom. Examine hands.</p>

<p>I place enormous value on my hands. I&#8217;m a pianist. And a programmer. Even so.</p>

<p>The other half of my head takes over at this point, and is appalled that I did this. Because yeah, that half is afraid of pain and actually wants to make sure that my hands remain in working order.</p>

<p>So. Meh. Right-hand knuckles are sore and a little swollen. Not a whole lot of skin damage, minimal bleeding, which irritates Half #1. I can&#8217;t go too far, or it&#8217;ll either attract or require attention.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the excuse. But I&#8217;m pretty sure that I am actually afraid of pain, and I&#8217;m pretty sure that that does need to change. It does disgust me that my hand stops a centimeter away from the wall, three times out of five. I lack complete control. Which does need to change.</p>",whitefacade textpattern.csv
2008-06-20 23:31:45,,"<p>Conference call with an east coast designer. Going over some branding materials for the company I&#8217;m working for. There were two marketing pieces, specifically, both of which used a stock photograph of a sunset. Or a sunrise, I suppose; can&#8217;t really tell. One had the image cropped, which was fine, but the resulting image had been slightly resized vertically, leaving it very slightly squished.</p>

<p>So I point this out, right. You can basically hear the guy blink, then mutter something about how he would be astonished if&#8230; something.</p>

<p>He checks it. And said this, slowly and deliberately:</p>

<p>Which I&#8217;m still not sure what to think about. I come across as different, apparently. I don&#8217;t take pride in that, I really don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m glad, yeah, that I don&#8217;t have to be lumped in with the American masses. And I guess it means&#8230; bleh. I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how to say this.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of things that I don&#8217;t know how to say.</p>

<p>I have a list, sort of, of things that I would say to people if the words could be said without changing anything. Make them aware without changing their perception.</p>

<p>Which is impossible, I think. The observer effect. They would know that this is how I see them, and they would change because of it.</p>

<p>Or the observer-expectancy effect. I expect they would change, and thus would subconsciously cause them to. Where they otherwise might not. &#8230; You see.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to know how much of this is real, and how much is in my head. Or how much in my head is real, rational and accurate reasoning, and how much is skewed and broken by whatever is wrong in there.</p>

<p>This chain of thought happens a lot. Always inconclusive.</p>

<p>All this.. stuff. Lock it all away. Keep it close to your chest. Sometimes it comes out. Ha, comes out screaming.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m tired of screaming.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know what else I can do.</p>

<p><strong>part two</strong></p>

<p>Normally I wouldn&#8217;t post something here so quickly after the last.. item.</p>

<p>Not that it matters. This isn&#8217;t for you.</p>

<p>Like I&#8217;m kidding anyone. Of course it is.</p>

<p>Be it noted that my brain has officially begun to implode. One thought leads to another, which begs the question of whether the second thought was born of any sort of reason whatsoever, rather than just a chemical progression. And if that&#8217;s the case, it follows that the very question itself is simply another step in a chain of reactions. As is this entry.</p>

<p>Which leaves me with this feeling that the whole <em>movement</em> thing is very, very futile.</p>

<p>Particularly considering that the feeling was inevitable.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s&#8230; <a href=""http://whitefacade.com/34/"">systemic</a>.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t think without questioning, and questioning the question. Ad infinitum. Ad nauseam. The thought process rebounds on itself in tighter and tighter circles, my head is spinning and I can&#8217;t think and dammit how is this all supposed to work if my mind isn&#8217;t my own or</p>

<p>No. It&#8217;s not that it isn&#8217;t my own.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the question of whether or not &#8220;I&#8221;, in the conventional sense, exist. That question is suddenly surprisingly plausible.</p>

<p>&#8230;</p>

<p>Tell me, please, is my mind just completely fucked? Because I honestly don&#8217;t know where to go. And I can stay here, I can. I&#8217;ve learned how to.. exist. Here. In this state.</p>

<p>Which might invalidate the rest of this entry, but what have you.</p>

<p>Going to go see fireworks tonight with [name] and his gf. Looking forward to it quite a lot; photos from the last round turned out well.</p>

<p>I tagged along on last year&#8217;s show as well, if I remember right. A lot can change in a year.</p>

<p><em>(but) I might crumble and I might take a fall again</em></p>

<p>Someone asked if that sort of situation was/is awkward, the whole third-wheel thing. And to a degree, it is. Though without question it helps that I approve of and get along with this year&#8217;s girlfriend. Not to imply that there are yearly models, which there aren&#8217;t&#8230; heh. Hopefully she&#8217;ll stick around a while. They&#8217;re good together.</p>

<p>A couple days ago I let go of the last little thread of hope that a particular relationship was going to work out. Interestingly, it felt good. Resolve is good. I&#8217;m not certain yet what implications this has. I&#8217;ve been trying to decide for some time that I&#8217;m okay with being.. well, single. Alone, in that regard. Hasn&#8217;t been working, given that half of me was still holding out for what-could-have-might-have-been. But, with that out of the way, I think I&#8217;m getting there.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m hesitant to rule out love, as it were. And the ones likely to be reading this are likely to say that it&#8217;s probably not a good thing to rule out completely. But to be completely honest with you, my dear or my good sir, I can&#8217;t picture myself with anyone. Not thinking of names or going through any list of potentials, just.. in general. I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;ve been cut out with the intent of fitting another piece. On the romantic side, at any rate. I think the other sides are taken care of.</p>

<p>So &#8211; is it weird to be the figurative third wheel? .. To a degree, yeah. Working on ruling that out. It&#8217;s difficult. Movies and nights and fireworks feel like they should be shared in multiples of two. One concern is that the established pair (speaking generally, not only for this situation) may feel somewhat uncomfortable themselves, given that if they get distracted with each other, there&#8217;s this guy on the sidelines with no distraction of his own. And they&#8217;re missing the mackin boat. &lt;/inside-joke&gt;</p>

<p><em>And that, kids, is why I selected Windows Mobile 6 as my companion of choice.</em></p>

<p>Anyway. Still progress to be made. I&#8217;m not moving in the typical direction that people progress in, from what I can see and what I&#8217;m told.</p>

<p><em>maybe a short-term (not years) dose of the meds to help your head, and then friggen find you a nice girl.</em></p>

<p>And, you know, maybe. But I can&#8217;t help but wonder, if.. hm. Words.

Still, hopefully none of you care so much. Because really, there isn’t a thing you can do about it. Take that.

Most everything has been moved off to <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/isaacbowen/"">flickr</a>, but not the stuff from before the arrival of my current camera.

I do like my phone. <span class=""caps"">HTC</span> 6800, Windows Mobile 6. Does more or less everything – wifi, bluetooth, ir, evdo, has a mini-sd slot and a 2mp camera.

But it can’t freaking tell time. Which I wouldn’t ordinarily mind, but when it goes off at 7:45 sharp to tell me that it’s 7:30am, or starts losing minutes off the hour at random intervals throughout the workday… This in combination with the fact that Microsoft has stalwartly refused to add a clock to the Zune ui, and it makes one wonder just what Steve Ballmer has against the natural progression of time.

At least their irrigation systems are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_ref-97"">intelligent</a>.

Spent most of the weekend in the general vicinity of Medford at my grandparent’s lakeside cabin. My uncle’s family snagged the property next door when it went up for sale, giving the clan reasonably generous access to the water. Which is good. Pictures on the way this evening; water sport and a fourth-of-july boat parade. And other such things. I don’t get to see the extended family nearly enough.

As long as pictures have been mentioned – <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/isaacbowen/sets/72157606022155308/"">even more fireworks</a> have been documented.

I think I like Flickr. Pretty sure. Yahoo’s done a good job of remaining objective and sane during the web 2.0 shift (with the exception of blue/pink, ha), and following suit with Google, their <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/"">developer network</a> is impressive.

But, that aside. My biggest issue with Flickr is the ability to track visitor stats. :) This was only a minor issue with the old photog section, but now I’m really completely distracted. I think I’m somehow hoping that people will randomly run into my work and rave over it. Which is sort of irritating; the attention-loving tendency is difficult to get rid of. I guess having a website doesn’t particularly help in that regard.

<em>Note: someone else called this an isaac-edit. I only borrowed the term for the title. Definitely not narcissism, just a poor attempt at humour.</em>

<em>That may or may not have been necessary.</em>

I’ve only just started to notice how much Calvin &amp; Hobbes is a cleverly structured satire on American culture and society. To a degree it’s completely obvious and up-front, as seen in the above excerpt, but… yeah. Cheers to you, Bill Watterson.

An oddly large number of people have asked how the stuff in <a href=""http://isaacbowen.com/photog"">photog</a> is done. My photo work (not really inclined to call it ‘photography’) can more or less be summed up in the same way as Calvin describes real life vs tv. Hyper-reality, I suppose. Lights and shadows and perfect faces.

I mean, really, the stuff I do is really straightforward. The idea is just to show you the world through brighter eyes, and it really doesn’t take a whole lot of work to make that happen. Not to ruin the suspense or anything. (Actually, to completely ruin the suspense, scroll all the way to the bottom before reading futher.)

But, as long as a few of you want to know how to achieve similar effects.. wish granted. Begin.
<h2>gnu image manipulation program – <span class=""caps"">GIMP</span></h2>
<a href=""http://www.gimp.org/""><span class=""caps"">GIMP</span></a> is a fantastic raster image editor that can be reasonably called a photoshop replacement for people who aren’t likely to be familiar with photoshop, as they won’t know the difference anyway. Also, it is cheaper. As in free.

Your first step is to procure a copy. Windows users can download the installer <a href=""http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/stable.html"">here</a>, which I think should take care of most of you. Linux users either already have a copy or are intelligent enough to get one on their own, and Macfolk probably already have photoshop because they can afford it. (<em>Some</em> of us have to pay for school. &gt;_&gt;)
<h2>grab the source photo</h2>
<a href=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/883.jpg""><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/883t.jpg"" alt="""" /></a>

For the purposes of this psuedo-tutorial, we shall use the image linked just above, lent by the estimable <a href=""http://anthonyrhook.com"">anthony r hook</a>.

Go ahead and open it up within <span class=""caps"">GIMP</span> (File → Open).
<h2>quick tour</h2>
<a href=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/884.png""><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/884t.png"" alt="""" /></a>

Take a couple moments to get an idea of where stuff is within <span class=""caps"">GIMP</span>. By default, there are two system windows – one on the left with the tool <del>palatte</del> <del>pallate</del> <del>palate</del> palette, and one on the right with the layer manager in the top half and some other things in the bottom that you can probably figure out with a good work ethic and an iq of more than 60.

When you open the image, note that it appears in its own independent window and can be put wherever you like. (Bonus points if you can make the windows look like the face of Marilyn Monroe.) Also note the menu bar at the top of the image window – File, Edit, blablabla Filters. All of these can also be accessed by right-clicking on the image itself, which could conceivably save you at least three seconds in total by the time we’re through here.
<h2>the only heading I can think of is “curves are attractive”</h2>
Curves are possibly the most important tool you will ever use.

I recommend that you write that line down and repeat it to yourself in bed at night. Then make sure you know how to open the Curves dialog (Colors → Curves) and scratch a diagram of the dialog-opening into your left forearm until it forms scar tissue. Probably a better conversation starter than whatever you currently have on your coffee table.

<a href=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/885.png""><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/885t.png"" alt="""" /></a>

As indicated in this screenshot, I typically use an S curve on the Value channel (channel selector’s near the top of the Curves dialog). If you’re still with me at this point, you’ve likely gathered how this thing works – pure black is in the lower left, pure white is in the top right. Dragging points on the curve has the effect of redistributing light and shadows, as it were. This sort of S deepens the shadows and intensifies the light, which (you may have guessed) is pretty typical of my photos.

<a href=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/886.png""><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/886t.png"" alt="""" /></a>

I do a similar thing with the Red channel, though not quite as drastically. Lowering the curve in the lower left removes red from the darker portions of the image, which has the effect of making the shadows look more blue-green. Raising the top-left a bit makes the light warmer. The two points in the curve combined make the photo look just a bit more.. old-school?

<a href=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/887.png""><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/887t.png"" alt="""" /></a>

Blue gets sort of dipped completely, if that makes any sense. Removing blue makes everything more red/green, again warming the light.

I didn’t touch the Green channel for this one, but feel free to experiment. “Always experiment.” That one can be tattooed on the back of your right hand.

Before clicking OK, toggle the Preview checkbox at the bottom of the dialog. This will show you the before and after versions of the photo, which might surprise you the first time you do this. If you get the curves right (“right”, whatever, there’s more than one “right” in this case), you’ll have achieved the hyper-reality effect that I mentioned earlier, and it may give you pause when you realize how bland the original – and by extension, a large portion of life – actually is.

Leastwise, that’s what it does to me.
<h2>v is for vicarious vignetting</h2>
Wiktionary defines a proper vignette as a picture <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vignette"">which vanishes gradually at the edge</a>. Such a vignette effect looks sort of <a href=""http://www.developertutorials.com/tutorials/photoshop/photoshop-vignette-effect-050619/page1.html"">like this</a>.

What we are doing here is not a proper vignette. Quite honestly, I think the proper vignette is tacky and rarely used tastefully.

That said, I’m not even sure what to call this. If you have a better term, do enlighten me.

<a href=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/889.png""><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/889t.png"" alt="""" /></a>

Grab the Ellipse Select Tool from the palette (or hit the E key), and draw an ellipse as shown in this screenshot. (Hint: the selection can be moved and resized after it’s initially plotted.) Right-click on the selection and go to Select → Feather. Enter 550 pixels as the feather selection value. Right-click the selection again, click Select → Invert. Copy your selection (ctrl+c or Edit → Copy) and paste (ctrl+v or Edit → Paste). If you look over to the layer list in the right-hand <span class=""caps"">GIMP</span> window, you’ll see that a “Floating Selection” layer has appeared. Click the New button (the little page with a yellow star in the corner, left-most button under the layer list). See the little eye buttons next to the two layers you have? Click the one next to the “Background” layer.

<a href=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/890.png""><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/890t.png"" alt="""" /></a>

You may or may not have any idea what you just did, but hiding the original layer like that should have cleared things up. Basically, you created a fuzzy frame to go around your photo’s subject matter – in this case, the tower – and put it in a layer of its own to be manipulated. The Feather function “feathers” the selection (e.g. makes it fuzzy; I typically use a feather value of roughly half of the selection’s width, but feel free to… feather to taste, I guess), and Invert simply inverts the selection so that we’re selecting the outer part of the photo, rather than the ellipse in the middle.

I’ll now assume all of that made sense and move on.
<h2>layer blending  (or: modes are your friend)</h2>
Before proceeding, turn the Background layer back on (little eye thing).

Now look just a little bit upward – see the Opacity and Mode selectors? Opacity controls opacity (cleverly), and Mode controls awesomeness. Open up the Mode drop-down selector and observe. These are generally known as “blending modes”, and are defined by <a href=""http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/glossary/ig/Blending-Modes/"">About.com</a> as “allow[ing] you to adjust how one layer or color mixes with the colors in the layers below.” For the programmers and/or math majors among you, <a href=""http://www.nathanm.com/photoshop-blending-math/"">this definition</a> should suffice.

At some point in time, I recommend that you open up a random photo in <span class=""caps"">GIMP</span>, duplicate it (right-click the layer and click Duplicate Layer), select the duplicate and go through all of the modes available to you. Having an understanding of what each one does is important – a lot of cool (and/or useful, but useful isn’t as fun) stuff can be done with these.

Of them all, I most often use Multiply. Followed by Hard Light, Overlay, Screen and Value, in that order.

<a href=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/891.png""><img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/891t.png"" alt="""" /></a>

And yeah – surprise – we’re going to use Multiply. Ensure that you have the vignetteish layer selected and change its mode to Multiply, as shown in the screenshot. This has the effect of intensifying the light/shadow/color surrounding the subject of the photo, which is both cool (y) and makes the stuff in the shadows less distracting. (Actually, I’m also going to go in at this point and darken the stuff in the bottom further – <a href=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/892.png"">screenshot</a> of what I’m doing.)
<h2>the end, and some epilogue things</h2>
<img src=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/894.jpg"" alt="""" />

And that’s more or less all there is to it. This wasn’t a terribly extreme edit, I grant you, but it should give you some ideas to work with. More could be done on this one, likely – were I a little more motivated, I might consider using the Clone tool to remove the branches sticking in from the left edge of the frame. Though this raises an important point – I try not to mess with what a photo contains. Most often, I don’t alter reality – I enhance it. (Or what I consider ‘enhancing’, at any rate.) My goal is to draw your intention to another way of looking at the world, and yeah, that occasionally involves removing distractions, but the priority isn’t ever to clean it up. It’s… to make life look like I think it was meant to be seen. Make it look its best.

Just… for the record. The final image is <a href=""http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/old_images/893.jpg"">available here</a> in fullsize, but don’t focus on making it look like that. Look at the original, and make it more alive. … Or dead, depending. Just keep in mind that death can also be vibrant.

Hit me up with questions, if you wish. Send me stuff you’ve worked on, if you like.

Ech. I don’t like posting huge chunks of lyrics. Waste of space, and it’s not like anyone’s going to read them anyway. But this one doesn’t lend itself to being abridged terribly well, so.. yeah. Deal.

I should probably also state, as a matter of principle, that the theology following should not be taken as strictly accurate.

That said, the guys are Canadian. &gt;.q
<blockquote><em>Trying to find a way
Getting better everyday
And I got you now I’m not alone
All I need in this life is one
One thing to believe in</em>

I’ve seen many a face
From young and to old
I’ve stolen their faith and I have broken their souls
Was here before Christ, had forgave you your sins
And paid your price and sealed your fate within
Days have come to an end
Today’s the day that we meet again
The self-inflicted inebriation (guilt never lies)

I’ve been waiting for the chance
To reunite this sick romance
Poison never hurt so good
So nice of you to speak of me
Your closest friend and enemy
And holy savior of masochists

Well it’s the dead end slave
From the alter to the grave
It’s the last days of our lives
In faith, amen

Time, it’s been so long
And now there’s nothing to say
I’m trying so hard to find the words to say
I’m tired of being, now I’m something I’m not
I can’t believe and I never thought
Days would come to an end
Well maybe someday we’ll meet again
If ever that day never comes
It would be too soon (my love)

I’ve been waiting for the chance
To nullify this sick romance
Pull the chord to detonate
So sick of you don’t speak of me
The reverend saint of misery
And holy savior of masochists

Well it’s the dead end slave
From the alter to the grave
It’s the last days of our lives
In faith amen

<em>Now I’ve found a way
Getting better every day
And I got you now I’m not alone
All I need in this life is one
One thing to believe in</em>

<em>Trying to find a way
Getting better every day
And I got you now I’m not alone
All I need in this life is one

<h2>first things first – flickr commons</h2>
Flickr has this side operation running, known as <a href=""http://flickr.com/commons"">The Commons</a>. The general idea is to make the public photography archives actually available to the public, and then give said public the opportunity to help organize and otherwise assimilate the materials that are brought in.

It’s impressive, really. They’ve got partnerships with the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian, and other similarly notable institutions. Sort of like <a href=""http://archive.org"">archive.org</a>, only cooler. The stuff in these collections is remarkable.

I’m speaking, obviously, of Super Mario Galaxies for Wii. It’s infuriating. Little happy dancing luma star people, <em>mocking</em> you when you fall through the either rapidly vanishing or oscillating floor tiles for the eighth time, trying to collect 100 little purple coin things that Luigi allegedly scattered about for whatever acrimonious reasons Luigi can possibly have.

2008-07-15 21:32:47,,"<p>Dear workplace:</p>

<p>So. What incentive do I have to excel here?</p>

<ol>
<li>Needless lockdown. My local admin levels were cut the day after I got here this summer. (Might I remind you that I was your <em>network admin</em> two years ago. Your intern. What does that say about you?) Fortunately, I managed to install Acrobat Reader (fricking Reader, so very dangerous) before my rights were &#8211; ha &#8211; abolished.</li>
<li>No access to [software]. This is understandable, due to licensing restrictions. To get around this (not my idea), [associate] gives me [supervisor]&#8216;s password, which throws me for a loop momentarily &#8211; huge security breach &#8211; but it allows me to do my job. Because of this access, I&#8217;m able to create the [document] in time, able to retrieve the reports from [software] that I need, and able to work with the [other software] documents needed for [client].</li>
<li>I hate [software]. Really, why can&#8217;t the [sector] industry manage to get decent software to work with? I can&#8217;t even use it from my own machine, because, even through most of the system files are on the shared drive (great idea there, btw, let&#8217;s put a couple random important programs in next to a massive dump of company documents), my machine lacks the dlls needed to actually run them. This happened last year, and I fixed it easily. But guesssss what &#8211; NO <span class=""caps"">LOCAL</span> <span class=""caps"">ADMIN</span> <span class=""caps"">RIGHTS</span>. I can&#8217;t even install the fonts the marketing guys mandate we use, and I can&#8217;t directly ask the system admin to do it &#8211; I have to ask my supervisor, who then has to ask him. W. T. F.</li>
<li>I appreciate the flexibility that this environment is capable of affording. It&#8217;s a good job, yeah. I mean, I&#8217;ve had the same salary for the last two years, but I have been late a couple times this round and thusly haven&#8217;t asked for the raise that [boss] mentioned when we worked out the agreement for me to come back this year.</li>
</ol>

<p>&#8230; Honestly. If I wanted to steal data, I could. I would. And could cause a lot of damage in the process.</p>

<p>My biggest frustration is that, technically, this entire team is not very apt. They&#8217;ve been taught, and a couple of them are pretty good at the functionality they use on a day-to-day basis. But what you have is capable of so much more, and if they knew how to use it, many many frustrations could be saved.</p>

<p>Random thought: why are half of the <span class=""caps"">WIDESCREEN</span> monitors here set at with a 4:3 display resolution?</p>

<p>Not that you know what that means&#8230;
bleh.</p>

<p>Anyway. I could be a valuable employee. But I&#8217;m sick of being locked down. They changed [supervisor]&#8216;s password on me hours after I finished the newsletter &#8211; which I needed her machine to do. The change was understandable, yeah. (But as long as I&#8217;ve mentioned [supervisor]&#8216;s machine &#8211; does it make sense to you that leaving her logged in 24/7 isn&#8217;t exactly best practice? I understand that her machine is set up to perform The Download only when she&#8217;s logged in, but &#8211; correct me if I&#8217;m wrong &#8211; isn&#8217;t a server designed to perform cron jobs like that?)</p>

<p>
I have no point. You can&#8217;t change anything here &#8211; what would you even change? It&#8217;s not like you can suddenly imbue your staff with actual skill. This place will continue to be crippled, and you don&#8217;t even know it. Best of luck.</p>

<p>Footnote. I&#8217;m focusing only on the technical side of things. Completely ignoring your actual business. I&#8217;m aware of this. But, see, the technical side of things is the only side I&#8217;m involved with. Kudos to you for being an amazing [sector] institution and all. But

2008-07-21 01:21:20,,"<p><txp:image id=""22"" /> The thought mostly goes like this:</p>

<p>People believe they are capable of feeling emotion of incredible depth. Falling in love or losing the object of such love to death or something. What have you. Weddings, for example. Happening all over the place. People wildly happy about, possibly, embarking on the archetypal journey of the rest of their lives with this particular Someone.</p>

<p>And to the individual, emotion can be all-consuming. Often is. But really, when it&#8217;s such a common thing, how deep can it really be? How <em>profound</em> can a feeling possibly be when you&#8217;re a tiny, almost completely insignificant part of a whole unit that, ultimately, has little significance of its own? Lots of little people running around feeling stuff. How much can that really mean?</p>

<p>If they were all united in simultaneous and unidirectional emotion, then perhaps it might have some value. But it&#8217;s not unique, it&#8217;s not special. You think it&#8217;s special, that it means something. But your tears and your laughter, why should anyone care?</p>

<p>.. Which goes into another thought about networking, and how people in your immediate vicinity do end up caring, which is probably for the best, else the fabric of society wouldn&#8217;t hold together.</p>

First things first – my first official photo-shoot-thing is complete. I’m almost completely without experience in such things, and suffice it to say that the endeavor was awkward. I need to tag along on someone else’s event again to see how these are best executed.

That said, I was able to hack a couple of shots into decent/acceptable shape. Any skill I may have is used back at my desk, less so in the field. An actual field, as it were.

For those of you in this or an adjoining zip code, Hannah’s grad party details will be presented in the very near future. Do make an effort to attend, if you know her at all. Her party is considerably later in the summer than most, and marks both the return of our dearly missed family and her imminent departure to North Dakota. .. It’s important, anyway; come if you can.

2:04pm. This job is a little ridiculous, I’ll have you know. It’s a good one, and I’m glad I’ve had it for the past couple years. But they’ve taken most of my responsibilities and handed them off to a new hire, leaving me to reformat assorted documents in line with the new company brand. That, and catch typos in whatever marketing manages to throw over here.

Most of today has therefore been spent on Wikipedia. <span class=""caps"">XKCD</span> had a strip up that mentioned <a href=""http://xkcd.com/451/"">deconstruction</a>, see. Things sort of went from there. Deconstruction to phenomenology/heterophenomenology (yeah, I made an embarrassing number of attempts before realizing how that was actually pronounced) to binary opposition to post-structuralism. My to-do list remains unchanged (e.g. every item is still checked off), but at least my brain hasn’t yet descended into complete atrophy. Even if I’ve had to resort to an education in post-modern philosophy.

Which I’m only half sarcastic about. Critical theory is something that I could conceivably spend a very long time pouring over, which is atypical in how I treat academia as a whole. (Though, one could reasonably argue that this isn’t atypical at all.) This is probably because my thought processes have run in deconstructionist lines (ha) for some time, and finally being exposed to this branch of philosophy serves to clarify what I sort of had an idea of to begin with.

Though I’m kicking myself for not seeking this stuff out earlier. Post-structuralism has been around since the 60s and phenomenology longer yet; can’t believe I didn’t learn these things years ago.

With lead feet in deep water, we cry out to live or die
Instead, we tread in waves to stay alive
Our heads above the grave,
but there’s no one to save us this time.

My life’s a painting I’ve done blind
With each brush stroke, you’ll see me blur every solid line
Over this canvas, I have stood with no one left beside me,
no one to decide if it’s good.

and you will hear me

Our voices raised,
are flawed but freeing
our souls so we can change and start again</em>

I had left on Friday, went from work to dinner and a movie with <a href=""http://www.new.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30042078&amp;l=b9d1b&amp;id=1602840136"">cool people</a> (here, have you seen the pencil trick?), and from there to the grandparent’s cabin in the general vicinity of Medford, WI. Can’t believe I didn’t feel the void sooner, but it wasn’t till arriving at the cabin (2:30am, mind you) that I realized the truth – my trusty Airwalks were no longer with me.

This would normally have triggered forty days of mourning, not unlike the ritual time period associated with the death of a loved pair of jeans. Though for the sake of my family, I put this behind me and carried on.

But lo – there they were, waiting for me. I thought they were recently deceased mammals of some sort, actually, which I now realize to be blasphemy and thusly recant.

Nathan informs me that the neighborhood had been abuzz, in fact, for the entire weekend – confirmed by his mother and the couple (I use the term loosely) next door. Whose shoes were these and why on <em>earth</em> were they <em>still there after three freaking days</em>. One would assume that such things would just be taken care of in the dead of night – like the bloated carcasses of deer on the side of Highway 8. But no. Was it the hoodie infestation (+10 points if you catch the quote), the riffraff with their skateboards and spraypaint? And would the problem have solved itself had Nathan actually put out a neon sign saying “seriously guys, pick up your shoes”?

*cough

Suffice it to say that the reunion was one of joy and also sand, as they were after all in the middle of a road for three days.

Counting down Mondays, two left after this one. My family returns Thursday from what might as well be the netherworld as far as the French are concerned.

The world is a strange and violent place.

Unrelated: my sister just called and my grandparents can’t find my family at O’Hare. This is probably not a big deal, but I am freaking out a little.

Never mind, apparently they’re fine.

The world, to continue, is a <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/2480975/Batman-sequel-to-The-Dark-Knight-Johnny-Depp-to-play-The-Riddler.html"">strange</a> and <a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/07/31/canada.bus/"">violent</a> place. If the essence of humanity is to spur on the evolution of one’s own race (“more than human”), then I think somehow humanity lost itself a long time ago. Though not for lack of trying, but a species that is pulling at both ends doesn’t seem to have a whole lot of prospects. .. Honestly, a decapitation on Greyhound?

Work has once again begun on Workplace Confessional and <a href=""http://anthonyrhook.com"">we’re</a> getting back to proper development of the thing. It will be cool. And <a href=""http://cakephp.org/"">cake</a> is beautiful.

My family is home. At long, long last. And now I have to go back and see if I’ve already said something about this, one moment. I hate redundancy.

No, just the O’Hare incident. They showed up around 11pm last night, Hannah and me having arrived at the house an hour or two earlier to retrieve the essentials from storage (read: basement) and get enough beds set up to keep everyone reasonably comfortable for the first night.

But really, they’re so, so glad to be back. I can imagine, that’s about it. Nine months is a long time to be an ocean away from everyone you know and love.

This is our piano. I’ve missed it. Quite a lot, actually. It’s highly flawed, ivories are missing and roughly the entire thing is flat by a full step. But it was built in, what, 1890? It really sounds beautiful. I sort of want to have the whole thing sampled for sound, just so I can keep it with me. Though I don’t think I could do it justice that way; replicating the way the strings reverberate across the sound board and through its body… yeah.

(afterthought: I might try recording some things again… idk, it’s been <a href=""http://exigraff.com/blog/554/studio-time-2007-03-25"">a while</a>. Little out of touch.)

But lo, I am employed. Bah.

It’s curious to me how even those with plans for the <a href=""http://isaacbowen.com/?s=archives&amp;q=infinite"">theoretical infinite</a> can live day-to-day as if they, in fact, had no such plans. I was cleaning out my inbox yesterday (22 emails, down from 1243 – tell me that’s not an accomplishment), found an email from a guy at school. He compared life (or just this existence, if you prefer; “life” may not be so appropriate) to an infant’s time in the womb (bear with me) – it’s a time of development and the emergence of consciousness, intelligence, personality, character. The ones who develop fully, who are fully prepared, are birthed into real and vivid life. The stillborn ones.. aren’t. So much.

In this metaphor, God could be considered to be the mother, weird as that sounds. It’s a plausible analogy, though. We can’t see him. Can’t even tell he’s there at times, maybe most times. There are occasions when we can “hear” him, like a mother speaks to her unborn child. Might even brush up against him, or thrash out just to feel some assurance that we’re not completely alone, floating in the dark.

Anyway. It makes sense, in a weird way. Original ponit, though – the majority of people with any sort of belief in God cling to that when they feel like they need it, in moments of weakness or pain. Rest of the time, it’s fire insurance, filed away, lost somewhere on the desk.

Which also makes sense; we’re creatures of an inherently limited perspective. One could conclude from this as the aforementioned guy-at-school did, that we were meant to actually have a life here and now, and not just walk around staring at the sky, carrying a hymn book.

And I agree with that, of course. Just difficult to know the balance.

On a completely different note, tomorrow is Friday.

2008-08-11 16:38:43,,"<p>I hate dreaming. Just so you know. They don&#8217;t make any sense. And yeah, I know dreams are often nonsensical, but mine are fundamentally&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. They&#8217;re alternately violent and sad and all in all, I&#8217;d just rather do without.</p>

<p>And last night&#8217;s friggen played out like like an overly epic film. Was walking with <code>1</code> and a general acquaintance, found a scarlet album/binder of some sort. Went over to examine it, and I looked back for a second, headlights behind us or something. Looked back, and they were gone. Just gone.</p>

<p>It was at that point that I discovered the spiders. Tiny red ones, crawling all over my arms.</p>

<p>This wasn&#8217;t alarming, for whatever reason. Irritating, yeah. I couldn&#8217;t get them off of me. But, slightly more alarming was the disappearance of the guys. Checked at the bar down the road, not there. Not sure what possessed me to ask at someone&#8217;s house, but apparently the woman who answered the door thought what had happened to my friends was similar and related to her predicament &#8211; namely, that she was entirely insubstantial. Opaque, completely, but as her husband demonstrated, matter passed through her like she didn&#8217;t exist.</p>

<p>This struck me oddly, actually. That&#8217;d be a very lonely state of existence.</p>

<p>All of this coincided with&#8230; I don&#8217;t have a word for it. The moon was reflecting the earth. It <em>looked</em> like the earth up there, brilliant blues and greens. And there were lines of light in the sky, not stars, but curves of white light being traced from horizon to horizon. Pieces of them would be fade, then would be traced again and renewed.</p>

<p>There was music, faintly. Only thing you could hear were the drums. Sounded like massive congas and timpanis, coming from somewhere in the lights.</p>

<p>Not sure how long all of that lasted. But when it all faded away, there was <code>1</code> and the other guy. (I don&#8217;t even know his name, ha.) Lying on the floor, apparently exhausted. Something about how there had been a party in the sky.</p>

<p>Ended with a slow zoom-out of the earth. Faint, faint drums. &#8230; Which is weird, considering that the entire dream up to that point was first-person.</p>

<p>At which point I woke up. Early, early morning, couldn&#8217;t sleep for hours.</p>

<p>I did, though; the following dream was violent and fast and confusing.</p>

It occurred to me that unlimited means unlimited, and I am thusly in the process of moving all ten thousand (exaggerated by maybe 1k) archived photos to Flickr. This may be a waste of space, but I’m finding old material that I had forgotten about over time – as illustrated.

Counting down hours, four point three seven five days. Then sweet, sweet freedom.

And by “freedom”, I mean leaving town almost directly after work on Friday, making the trip to somewhere in southern Wisconsin for another wedding. I’ll be in Chicago, actually making use of my rent payment, not to mention the cable bill, on Sunday. Woo.

I should note that the title of this and <a href=""http://exigraff.com/blog/887/what-do-you-do-with-a-clumsy-czech"">part 1</a> come from my Decathlon coach’s son, who is probably all of four or five years.

<em>it could have been anyone</em>

This picture is interestingly the 911th image I’ve uploaded for this site since… well, since early February 2007. Or whenever #1 was, I have since deleted it for some reason I can’t recall. It was probably important.

Not that it matters, just a point of note.

<em>it could have been anything</em>

Today is moving day (he wrote at 1:04am). My stuff’s in the car, and I’m at the cousins’ – conveniently located at the halfway point between 54501 and Chicago. It’s a full moon tonight, and over Lake Michigan.. beautiful. Going to get a few shots online when I have time to actually go through them. And the wedding. &gt;_&gt; A friend of the family was wed today, which – joyous occasion though it may be – means quite a lot of post-processing time afterwards.

<em>but we come we go</em>
<em>we say that we know</em>
<em>but we don’t remember, and we, we don’t remind each other</em>

Summer went fast. I got to see more of the people I wanted to see, with the exception of my family. (Though now they’re on the same continent, and I’ll be back for Labor Day.) Classes start Thursday already… I wish there was more of a break between the summer and fall routines. But I have a few days, I guess. Time enough to pay my <a href=""http://exigraff.com/blog/855/an-unfortunate-event"">court fees</a>, send in a couple job applications (hoping to add one to the existing class/work schedule), and.. meet Billy? Apparently my roommates went off and got another dog off craigslist. I am uncertain how the corgi is taking this.

So, anyway. Time again. Looking forward to going back to a place that’s mine. Albeit rented. Not totally sure where my “home” is at the moment, but it doesn’t really matter.

Brane’s not completely working in a straight line just now, time for sleep. All my best to you, dear reader, in whatever ventures you undertake.

This is another sky. For which I apologize. It’s too easy to take pictures of. I sort of feel like I’m copping out every time I take a shot. I’ve been half-heartedly uploading more things to <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/isaacbowen/"">flickr</a>, but this inconvenient creative block has set in. Give it time.

<a href=""http://www.myspace.com/crystalcastles"">Crystal Castles</a>, on an unrelated note, is worth a listen. They were featured on <a href=""http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=3530822107858735757"">Sudsonbleeker</a>, and for good reason. Go forth and check them out.

Aaand the <a href=""http://exigraff.com/blog/855/an-unfortunate-event"">parking meter saga</a> has come to an end. August 8th was the final hearing, which my attorney attended in my stead. (He did not call me afterwards, and did not answer my call to find out what happened.) The court fee was paid off today, which felt… no, not good, but it’s over and resolve is a good thing. This theoretically should have been over yesterday, but several things prevented that from happening.

The first time I was over at Branch 23, back in March, the attorney took me to the Social Services office to find out how to go about paying the fees. So, this is where I returned. Yesterday, the day I had worked out with a rep from the Branch on the phone last month, seeing as I couldn’t pay it in person by the original due date.

Could have sworn he said cash was alright on the phone, but apparently not. Money orders only. This required a visit to something of a low-income urban area (carrying a non-trivial amount of cash), in order to purchase a money order in the correct denomination.

It occurs to me that I’m trying to make this sound slightly dramatic, and it’s really not.

Got back to the branch office, only to find that the person I had talked to earlier had left for the day. A new guy looked up my record, and informed me that, while there were no fees listed on record, he would go check with some other office in the building. Surprise – the fees actually did exist. But please, come back tomorrow when the paperwork is ready and on-hand.

And so, I made the trip back today. A hispanic chased me out of the parking lot I used last time, and the security guards at the door confiscated my industrial Sharpie. (One of them almost took my <a href=""http://exigraff.com/blog/817/these-are-my-keys-"">spork</a>, but the other pointed out that the tines were really quite dull, and what was he could he possibly do with it anyway?)

But – got the fees paid. It took them half an hour to sort out what was going on, granted, but they’re paid.

So. Nearly five months and more than a thousand dollars later, it’s over. My only souvenir (not counting the new and shiny criminal record, which will be around for the next five years) is the original misdemeanor complaint, which I shall reproduce below for your entertainment.
<blockquote>P.O. Seigera #15371, complainant, now appears before the Circuit Court of Cook County and states the following:

And then it goes on a bit with signatures and things.

I think “knowingly obtained unauthorized control” is somewhat unreasonable. Considering that I neither hacked the parking meter from the pavement, nor strong-armed it from its base, but merely saw it lying innocuously off to the side of the road, quite free of any… well, it doesn’t matter anymore. Forget it.

… I have really no idea how to react to the whole situation. It’s preposterous. On every level. Down to the hispanic who wouldn’t let me park today.

Bah. What do you do.

Day one of classes over. First one was cancelled, due to a debilitating back injury on the part of the professor. Second was alright, generally introduction to C++. The course shouldn’t be a problem.

This isn’t really a tutorial, just some ideas and how this particular take ended up with this given combination. Mostly because I lack the motivation to take a screenshot of every single step, and I highly doubt it would be useful enough to anyone to be worth the time.

So.

I’m assuming that you’ve procured a copy of <span class=""caps"">GIMP</span>, as used earlier. <strong>Step one</strong> for this particular image (grab the original <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/isaacbowen/2819609979/in/photostream/"">here</a>) is to correct the lens distortion that we’re getting. This is can be accomplished with the eponymous Lens Distortion tool, found in Filters → Distorts. As illustrated, this has uses other than inducing artificial fisheye – using a <code>Main</code> value of -7.7 and an <code>X shift</code> of -100 did a fairly good job of correcting the issue.

<strong>Step two</strong>: Curves. Good stuff. Raise the lights, dim the shadows. Boost the mid-range greens to bring out the fields a little more. Minor tweakage of reds/blues, nothing huge.

<strong>Three</strong>: the vignette trick from earlier (”<a href=""http://exigraff.com/blog/871/impress-your-friends-perform-an-isaac-edit-at-parties"">vicarious vignetting</a>“ apparently sounded like a good name at the time).

<strong>Four</strong>: Colors → Components → Decompose. Leave it at <span class=""caps"">RGB</span>, decomposing to layers, hit OK. This results in a new monochrome image with three layers, depicting the values of the three color components. You can often get better black/white image results by selecting one of these three layers (or mixing them together), rather than just going with a straight-up desaturation. But – not to get off track – copy the Red layer, paste it back over the original image. Hit the new-layer button to .. give it its own layer, then change the layer mode to Value. You can figure out what this does.

<strong>Five</strong>: duplicate the bottom image layer (the one with the actual picture), put the duplicate on top, change the mode to Saturation.

I’m not going into much detail here, apologies. Just throwing out some ideas.

My room is now equipped with a projector. It’s mounted on the ceiling directly above my head when in sleeping position (my head, not the projector); I have hope that it will not fall on me while I sleep.

A Halo-like dream concluded in a novelty store of some sort, with a Dave-Matthews-esque song playing overhead. The only line I can remember: “even the babies are racist”. .. No idea.

Fingerprints, paperwork, taken care of. My state of employment is now at the mercy of City Hall.

we move for all mankind,
a million miles from everything we’ve ever known
and we’re on their hearts and minds,
a million heads are bowed to bring us safely home
hemmed in by emptiness, a million ways that everything could be undone
this hollow in my chest is filled with reasons not to sing but I found one (I know)

we are not alone, we feel an unseen love
we are sons and heirs of grace
we are children of a light that never dims
a love that never dies, keep your chin up child
and wipe the tears from your eyes

in sleep we saw ourselves,
a million years
we had been waiting there it seems
while someone weaves a spell,
a million stars look on in witness to our dreams

we feel an unseen love
we are children of light
stand ready and tall, reflect the light",exigraff wp_posts.csv

2008-11-02 17:09:23,,"<p>I am angry, sarcastic, embittered and cynical. I hold few beliefs, one of which is that a limited sense of identity is the root of all evil. Likewise, a limited point of view is at the root of controversy. The Christian faith addresses the first point. The second just takes an open mind.</p>

<p>These two factors, combined with what they tell me is are malfunctioning synapses, have resulted in who and what I am now. A Christian who believes in nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing&#8221; is obviously meant as a generality. (We&#8217;re already talking wildly disparate components of self; I might as well qualify this one.) I believe God exists. I believe humanity is, outside of God, screwed.</p>

<p>My default perspective is neutral. But for every stance that is ever taken, there&#8217;s an alternative side that is not being heard out properly. To that end, maybe defense is my &#8220;calling&#8221;, so-called. I&#8217;ll rarely take sides, but if you&#8217;re passionate about your conviction I&#8217;ll do everything in my power (until such time as it becomes apparent that this action is futile) to show you the other side as if you were there. I try my hardest to see all sides of everything, inasmuch as that&#8217;s possible for a human. The side effect is a personal passion that has gone into complete paralysis. You can&#8217;t choose sides if you can see more than one of them clearly, and &#8211; this is important &#8211; you have no faith in your own ability to make a valid choice.</p>

<p>This is again a description of the most common situation. There are a couple exceptions.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m writing this. There was a set of stimuli that put me here, but I don&#8217;t remember what they were. Free will doesn&#8217;t exist &#8211; there&#8217;s another point. It&#8217;s an illusion critical for the function of society, but from a perspective that factors in time as a dimension, free will cannot be seen to exist. It&#8217;s an argument that has no effect on anything, as freedom of choice is apparent when your perspective is limited to this point in time. But the underlying thought that what happens next is inevitable takes a lot of passion out of life.</p>

<p>Passion, because that&#8217;s what drives a person to act in such a way that it effects change. I say that at the core, nothing has, will and will ever change. Only the way in which we structure our interpretation has variance.</p>

<p>Until Jesus shows up. And yeah, he&#8217;s coming. To put the world right. God knows we&#8217;re not doing it ourselves.</p>

Happy new year, internet. Pic unrelated.

Yes, it took a new year to make something happen here. Last entry was on October 14th; so sorry to keep the two of you waiting. To make up for it, see here: a new design.

I'm at home in Wisconsin, pizza on the counter, family's watching Kung Fu Panda. I am in the kitchen, that being the only room in the house where the wireless signal is reliable. &gt;_&gt;

My contribution to the internet's evolution: This site is now running on Wordpress. At long, long last. Textpattern may or may not be lost, but at this point, it's not worth the trouble.

Plus, WP 2.7 is remarkably shiny. I'll be cleaning up this hackery over the next few.. days... presumably before 2010. This theme you see here is basically Kubrick, slashed and diced beyond all recognition. But did you notice?

Happy new year and all that. Here goes another.

<strong>our future presentation

So I take back what I said about it being winter in Chicago. Because, evidently, it is the third week of September. When I left this place (read: spent an hour chiseling my car out of the snow/ice and then fled), this city was frozen over at -15 fahrenheit. And now, it's 32 degrees with a mist. A <em>mist</em>.

On the upside, the third week in September is idyllic for my own idiosyncratic photo-taking. I wandered through the neighborhood this afternoon, photographing alleys and such.

Jeff's truck has a semi-shattered windshield, broken blinkers, non-functioning wipers and a binary gas pedal. To its credit, however, the key will turn in the ignition with usually less than a dozen attempts.

They turned off the gas to the apartment today. No communication, just shut it off. Most probably because there is no service contract. I tried to set one up in mid-November, but they apparently were less than motivated to take my money.

This explains why the pizza bits took forever: they were baking by pilot light.

Long day. A largely successful design proposal for the CPL intranet, and the three Oracle servers had a deathmatch toward the end of the day (#1 and #2 evicted #3 from the cluster entirely of their own accord, at which point #1 crashed - leaving #2 the clear victor). The apartment's gas is still out; according to the service provider the apartment either doesn't exist or in fact has gas service activated.

The apartment will have heat on Monday, at the earliest. And I have elected to believe that the electrician who wired this place was wise beyond the comprehension of mortals, as I cannot fathom any reason for dedicating a circuit to a single kitchen outlet and the lights from both the kitchen and bathroom. Moral of this story is that, if you put a space heater in the kitchen, the bathroom will become a very dark place. Also the refrigerator will die.

Leaving us with no heat, hot water, cooking gas, or freezer (irony!). But as long as the living room circuit remains functional, the tv will continue to contribute a nontrivial amount of heat, keeping the apartment within habitable bounds. I do try to remain optimistic. &gt;_&gt;

2009-01-15 10:55:53,Script: Grandcentral Call Trigger,"<a href=""http://grandcentral.com"">Grandcentral</a> is a wonderful concept. No, really. It's just <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/grandcentral-help-getting-started/browse_thread/thread/7968f346bad6dcb0?pli=1"">sort of dead</a> at the moment. Or, if not dead, lapsed into ... functional stagnancy. Something. The project hasn't visibly moved since April of 2008, and while I still reserve a small amount of hope that the dev team has actually been active since then, there's little reason not to hack around with the service as it stands now.

I therefore give you what follows (after the break) - a commandline script for triggering Grandcentral calls. Written some time ago, as a disclaimer, but it still works. It's not particularly innovative, or clever, but combined with <a href=""http://do.davebsd.com/"">GnomeDo</a> I've found it to be terribly useful. Working as I do in a basement.

(Note: This was written on a Linux box, but presumably it should be fine on Windows as well - just change the executable path on line 1 as appropriate and place the script <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(variable)#DOS.2C_OS.2F2.2C_and_Windows"">somewhere obvious</a>. Can't speak for OS X. And OS/2 users? Let it go, man. Let it go.)

My life goes like this about a year and a half ago i was living on my own with this really cute boy Named John Weston shortly after he moved in i found out i was having a baby with him .. things were going ok till about my 4 month being prego he started to cheat on me.. then he came back to me soon after that and i was thinking things were going great cuz they were tell i had the baby and i found out she was sick and was not doing well eatting on her own and was not gainng weight like she should.. they put her in the hospital for it and put a feeding tube in and that helped some .soon after that they did some testing on her and everything was fine after that. Then we got to come back home and soon after that she got sick again and was put back in the hospital cuz she was throwing up alot and was sick and not pooping and then when i was in the hospital with her the 2 time they put leds on her head to check to make she everything was ok with her.. then they did a ct scan on her head and they found a bump there then they did a scan on her tummy and found things were bad there.She was sick from the good start food she was on so then they put her on something different and she is getting better everyday at her own pace. Then i went to the doctor after i got home the 2 time with her and they told me she had OPITZ G Syndrome . Every day i look at her and say what a pretty lil girl she is and i look at her and say to myself why would anyone take off. There is a great person out there that can be a great father if he puts his brain to it and see what it is like. it is the best thing that has ever happened to me is to have Madelyn grace in my life. i am so proud that she is here after all of that and i wish her father John Weston would step up and help out with her cuz he is the one who help make this pretty lil girl.. there is more to him then running away from his kid.. he can be a man and a father and a great person when he takes his meds he has BIPOLOR and i don't care about that . that is what makes him, him for eveyone out there.. there is a person out there for everyone in the world.. love is love and i geuss he run from what he did to make others happy in his life..

Do listen to this. It is worth your time.

I've largely moved into the new apartment, making do at present with a desk/pc, piano/barstool, futon, filing cabinet and a coffee table that the previous tenant left behind. Also some lights from Ikea that I had hanging about. I'm unaccustomed to ending the day in a quiet place, and I think this apartment will do well.

Until July. It's a short lease, and the second bedroom will be filled for the final three or four months. The tentative plan is to keep expenses down for the time being, rebuild my savings, and move again in the summer. Find a decent single-bedroom somewhere, move in with a cat. Live unremarkably, work and classes and whatever else presents itself as necessary.

I've been making a conscious effort to simplify things, cut down on the relative melange I'm wading through. Inasmuch as I'm able; some of it's unavoidable. This being America (uh-MER-ca) and all.

More music (e.g. things recorded from my piano) is coming. I have some pieces in my head, still working them together.

<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>basically do this</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Install the font and all packages named above, also the Dust theme (non-Ubuntufolk, I do apologize, but you're on your own). Download themagetar.gz, extract to your home directory (e.g. /home/username/, or ~/). Presumably you can handle setting the wallpaper.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Conky will run the system info panel out of the box (after changing your gmail acct/password info in .conkyrc, and assuming you have python and weather set up correctly) - just run `conky` from a terminal.  Run `conky -c ~/.conkyrc2` to get the clock going. To make this run automatically when you log in, open up the Sessions app (System -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Sessions, `gnome-session-properties`, or use gnome-do! ctrl+space) and add `conky &amp; conky -c ~/.conkyrc2` as a startup item.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">I have gnome-do running in Docky mode - instructions on setting that up <a href=""http://do.davebsd.com/wiki/index.php?title=Docky"">are here</a>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">You'll note that there is no gnome-panel visible here. There actually is one on the bottom edge of the screen, set to autohide. Should you attempt something similar, you can use gconf-editor to make the panel slide offscreen completely (e.g. not leaving a bit of it visible as a visual cue). From a terminal, run `gconf-editor` and navigate to /apps/panel/toplevels/(panel name, mine is top_panel_screen0). Ensure 'auto_hide' is checked, and change 'auto_hide_size' to 0. Close.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">And I think that's it... Oh, you may or may not want to use the Dust theme as-is here. I've modified my copy to be greyscale, which works well. As I haven't bothered to repackage it nicely, you can download it <a href=""http://isaacbowen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/duststar.gz"">here</a> (dump in ~/.themes and set your theme to Greyscale Dust (available in the Appearances app).</p>

2009-02-18 16:04:53,2012 CANNOT COME SOON ENOUGH,"It is an important and popular fact that things are not always as they seem. Douglas Adams. Its less-popular inverse is of no less import: that some things are <em>exactly</em> as they seem. The human masses, for example. Utterly dense. Not so bright. Really fantastically unintelligent. Idiots, the lot of them, but this was never so glaringly obvious before the advent of mainstream social networking. Turns out, millions of inconsequential persons feel liberated and somehow special when exposed to each other, adorned with animated backgrounds and with liberal use of sparkling text. Tom, bless him, saw a need circa 2002 and was happy to oblige. ""No one needs to feel lonely,"" Tom concluded, ""when <em>I</em> can be their friend. LOLOL.""

Facebook's birth was in large part inevitable. With a sizable chunk of the pubescent population jerking each other off on MySpace, it was only a matter of time before the more lofty crowd looked down their collective nose and concluded that they deserved the same sort of opportunity. But not with <em>them</em> involved, please. Cue Facebook.

And all was well with the world. The emo bands, <span id=""query"" class=""query"">the pre-teen females and the </span><span id=""query"" class=""query"">libidinous</span><span id=""query"" class=""query""> married men had their place, separate from the educated and far-more-mature collegiates who were <em>totally</em> past high-school drama. As expected, Facebook became more refined and feature-rich over time. MySpace festered. Everyone was happy.</span>

<span class=""query"">But apparently Facebook had growth on the corporate brain, oddly enough, and in 2006 lowered the drawbridge to the leper colony where Tom reigned lord and king - thus contaminating forever the blue-blooded </span><em>haut monde</em>. One may assume that Tom was also somewhat distressed.

<span class=""query"">Some will argue until they are blue in the face (or more blue, anyway) that this was the beginning of the end. The <a href=""http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1532225,00.html"">news feed</a>, the <a href=""http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=23612952130"">new layout</a> (remember <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/board.php?uid=27233634858"">that fiasco</a>?) and godhelpus the <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/Facebook-welcomes-outside-services/2100-1038_3-6186471.html"">applications platform</a> - every major addition to Facebook's feature set has been simultaneously hailed as brilliant and decried as catering to the narcissistic masses. These are both largely fair assertions.
</span>

<span class=""query"">Interestingly, Facebook has in this developed a sort of <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?timeline"">trend</a>. They create something arguably innovative, release it, observe the subsequent outcry, apologize, perform some perfunctory alterations, and - realizing that the user is an idiot - leave it in place. The once-affronted user base calms down and realizes that this actually isn't so bad, though seriously Zuckerberg, why cant u put custom html and s*** in ur wallz.
</span>

<span class=""query"">... I should at this point apologize for digressing from my original thesis, though as it went unstated (so much for formal prose) you probably didn't notice. The present Facebook controversy is, of course, their terms of use. With <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics"">more than 175 million</a> members actively dumping their lives into the system, Facebook's use of said members' information has come into question. Someone decided the ToS was <a href=""http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=54434097130"">due for a change</a>, triggering the traditional wide-spread panic, <a href=""http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=54746167130"">an apology</a> from Zuckerberg, and - amusingly - an invitation for user input. This is </span><span class=""query""><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/FacebookPreviews"">not unprecedented</a>,</span><span class=""query""> and should probably be applauded as it reflects Facebook's ostensible focus on user opinion. Thing is, this issue has gotten a nontrivial amount of <a href=""http://news.google.com/news?oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=97ScSdvYF4zAMbuLrJIF&amp;resnum=1&amp;ncl=1304633245"">syndicated attention</a> and, consequently, it has forced its way through the skulls of a very large number of users.</span><span class=""query""> Providing impetus for quite a lot of idiots to spout off in public.</span>

<span class=""query"">Which, ultimately, is all I care about. There will always be debate. Companies will continue asking their customers for their valuable opinions, while being perfectly aware that the average customer is not dissimilar to a partially-articulate simian. This is particularly true of the social networking crowd, and thanks to the miracle of Facebook, we have yet another stunning example of how badly we all <em>suck</em>.
</span>

<span class=""query"">All of the following (after the break), every last piece of scintillating verbiage, are taken directly from the aforementioned <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=69048030774"">feedback group</a>, where users are asked ""</span>to give input on Facebook's terms of use"". Please, enjoy. And bear in mind that the difference between you and any one of these idiots is negligible.

And here we are. This is a very small sampling, despite the immediately following footnote. Do go on and <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/wall.php?id=69048030774"">discover for yourself</a> how far the bounds of human stupidity and ignorance may stretch.

Good news: Ballmer does not appear to have established global martial law. (That said, if surrendering my rights to Steve-o was a requisite for this sort of lifestyle, I doubt I'd complain.)

Lastly: <a href=""http://technabob.com/blog/2009/03/02/human-relationship-calculator/"">this</a> seems not entirely unlike <a href=""http://www.thateden.co.uk/dirk/"">this</a>.",exigraff wp_posts.csv
2009-03-02 21:02:13,,"<p>Right, let me explain a few things. Not because they beg explanation, but because .. okay, partly because I&#8217;ve ended up working with people who are a bit confused by my less than typical approach to things and it&#8217;s not worth the time to explain all of this to them, but I feel like I need to have it articulated in my head so that /I/, at least, know where I&#8217;m coming from.</p>

<p>So.</p>

<p>First off. I do not have the right to hurt anyone, bring anyone else down. This seems like a no-brainer, but it&#8217;s not insignificant.</p>

<p>Secondly (and conversely), I&#8217;m fairly convinced of my own insignificance. This is in an absolute sense, and yeah, you also are fairly insignificant. However, everything&#8217;s relative, and I&#8217;m fully cognizant that if all individuals adopt this mindset society will erode. Therefore, carry on.</p>

<p>Third. When I say I have no opinion, I have no opinion. &#8220;But everyone has an opinion,&#8221; one of you has countered. Not so, and this follows from point number one. If you actually believe that (1) your opinion is insignificant and (2) that you are wholly unqualified to render an accurate judgment, you will find yourself neutral on quite a lot of subjects. &#8230; That said, carry on with your own opinions and such for the same reasons as before.</p>

<p>Fourth. I have no romantic/sexual goals. Please understand that I do not play the whole casual-pursuit-of-the-other-gender game, nor do I dream of some sort of idyllic, meaningful relationship down the road. Not happening. I do not intend to change this.</p>

<p>Fifth. The world is a bloody depressing place from here. But, as I have no interest in dragging anyone else down with me (see number one), I don&#8217;t agonize. I will not be that emo kid, for one thing. Irony is that most of my genuine emotions are not so positive, but &#8211; those are staying here.</p>

<p>Lastly, and this is important. I don&#8217;t believe that what I have to offer as a person is very valuable to any other given person, and that there are equal or greater odds of someone, anyone else having something better to offer in a relationship. (Badly/inaccurately phrased, but you get the idea.) Recognizing that most people feel slightly more optimistic about themselves, it makes sense to bow out of the picture whenever possible and let the more eager individuals play humanity.</p>

<p>.. The people who might read this probably know all of this. You are the exception case that I&#8217;m not sure how to handle. I feel like, had we never met, your life would have gone on and you&#8217;d have found other friends, and you&#8217;d be fine. One fewer depressed bastard darkening your alloted lifetime. However, if you&#8217;re reading this, you&#8217;re not a relationship that I can terminate without hurting you. Not an option.</p>

<p>Not that I want to, not at all. There are precious few people that I need and love, love such that they can reciprocate. You can&#8217;t love someone unless you know how deep their mind and soul runs, and given that I try to keep my crap under lock and key&#8230; well. Everyone&#8217;s insane, everyone&#8217;s a psychosocial mess, I know this. But people need people, and despite being a slightly less optimal human, if I&#8217;m not /needed/ on some level, I don&#8217;t have a reason to live.</p>

<p>That and the people who might read this are pretty awesome. No sense making this about me, the odds are good that you&#8217;re a fairly stellar individual.</p>

<p>Conundrum is that I can&#8217;t hold up my end of a healthy relationship without undoing all of the above. One, I wouldn&#8217;t know how to begin, two, a nontrivial chunk of my personality is derived directly from all of that crap. I don&#8217;t know who I&#8217;d be.</p>

<p>So basically, in order to maintain some semblance of function in this world, I&#8217;m staying numb and <em>not</em> thinking about this as much as possible. Seems like the only plausible option just now.</p>

Twenty four skies
Twenty four failures
Twenty four tries
Twenty four finds me
In twenty-fourth place
Twenty four drop outs

Life is not what I thought it was twenty four hours ago
Still I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You
And I'm not who I thought I was twenty four hours ago
Still I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You

There's twenty four reasons
To admit that I'm wrong
With all my excuses
Still twenty four strong

See I'm not copping out, not copping out, not copping out
When You're raising the dead in me

Oh, oh I am the second man
Oh, oh I am the second man now
Oh, oh I am the second man now
And You're raising these -

Twenty four voices
With twenty four hearts
With all of my symphonies
In twenty four parts
But I want to be one today
Centered and true
I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You
You're raising the dead in me

Oh, oh I am the second man
Oh, oh I am the second man now
Oh, oh I am the second man now
And You're raising the dead in me

I want to see miracles, to see the world change
Wrestled the angel, for more than a name
For more than a feeling
For more than a cause
I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You
And You're raising the dead in me

Twenty four voices
With twenty four hearts
With all of my symphonies
In twenty four parts.

Ran into these guys (e.g. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Blue+Foundation"">Blue Foundation</a>) via... something on last.fm. Not bad at all. The album is a somewhat eclectic blend of genres, as trip-hop is wont to be.

Speaking of. Sort of. Röyksopp's new album - <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/R%C3%B6yksopp/Junior"">Junior</a> - is due out on the 23rd. It's been leaked (surprise), and while I fully intend to purchase the album when given the opportunity, it's actually something less than I expected. Quality work, no doubt, but less distinctive than <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/R%C3%B6yksopp/The+Understanding"">The Understanding</a>. And it's been four years, to be fair; understandable that their sound's changed. Just an unexpected direction. Though bringing in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lykke_Li"">Lykke Li</a> was a good move, in my almost entirely uneducated opinion.

Back from spring break, a few days in the frozen (thawing, actually) northern wastelands with the family. Discovered (1) that Dreamhost's backup server killed itself, hopefully for noble reasons but probably not, and (2) that my extended family, true to form, is perfectly capable of having their mortal crises outside of US borders.

2009-03-25 00:25:47,,"My grandmother was Sherin Rose Bowen. It's only now, after the fact, that I'm learning the extent of her work and the depth of her heart.

These past two weeks have been surreal. I had returned to my family's home in Rhinelander, Wisconsin on March 14th, taking the train from Chicago to Milwaukee and a bus to Wausau. Somewhere in those days it was mentioned that Grandma had fallen. It honestly did not grab my attention. I knew she was in Nicaragua, I knew a simple fall couldn't hurt her.

Her birthday was on February 28th, the same date as my dad's. I had a photograph, taken last summer at Lake Isadore. Inside of the boathouse, looking out the open doors onto the water, white in monochrome. A door into light. I had intended to have this printed and framed, mailed to the house in Stevens Point. But then, she was in Nicaragua, and it wasn't a rush. I'd give it to her upon her return.

But she fell, and you know how that story goes.

It didn't really hit me immediately. Even after the details started coming in mid-week, numbers and percentages. I honestly didn't think it would play out the way it did. It wasn't really a conviction, but I did expect that she'd pull through, that the appropriate miracle would take place and I would see her knitting at the cottage this summer. So I returned to Chicago and focused on what I could do, objective work, trying to be useful for a family that was badly shaken by what was happening on another continent.

I suppose it was partly the way that it was discovered she was gone. Nothing immediate, no moment you could isolate and analyze and point out exactly what went wrong. Her body was still there, but her consciousness, her soul, had quietly left.

We met in Two Rivers, at the Smith's home. Came together, tried to make sense of the madness that had decended utterly without warning. I still hadn't fully processed it. Cognitively, yes, I knew all of the details and understood how the days had played out. Emotionally, hadn't yet touched it. Still had work to do.

But Sunday morning, the house was halfway empty. Some were at church, the rest were either sleeping or meeting together upstairs. Went to the piano room, shut the door, and poured everything out onto the keyboard. Eulogy for my grandmother. I don't remember ever crying so hard.

I still don't understand why it had to happen like this. I doubt if anyone but God does.

No one got to say goodbye.

The legacy she left is great. Nigh unfathomable.  The response you all have had on this website alone is testament to that. To have the story of her life in her own words is a treasure that at the very least indicates God's hand in this. Her accomplishments of the last two decades alone could have taken a lifetime, so, perhaps, she had done all that she had been given to do.

I have the same difficulties and doubts as anyone. But I can't imagine experiencing a loss like this without being able to look past the grave.

I don't know where to begin.

It seems impossible (impossible, concluded definitively from a sample set of four) to have a semester without some sort of catastrophe.

This round - my grandmother, Sherin Rose Bowen, has... yeah, I still don't have a phrase for this that I'm okay with using. 'Gone on ahead'. The story's been posted at <a href=""http://sherinbowen.com"">sherinbowen.com</a>, I linked it last time. Such an enormous shock. Her birthday was on February 28, shared with my dad, her son. She was in Nicaragua at the time, leading an Eco-Tour and carrying out other business, and for that reason I held off on printing/framing a photo as her gift (<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/isaacbowen/2644457609/"">this one</a>, of the boathouse at her lakeside cottage). There was supposed to be time.

My mom's mother died (<em>died</em>, what an awful, abrupt word) some years ago. Old age, it was her time. I confided in my grandfather that, yes, I was bored sitting there in the care facility where she spent her last couple weeks. Callous little eleven-year-old. &gt;_&gt;

But that was different, altogether. A horrible thing for my mom to go through, no doubt, but at least it was expected. Everyone saw it coming.

This time, my dad's mother was put into a coma and never came back.

No one got to say goodbye.

The outpouring of support, the stories and memories coming in from every continent has been overwhelming. I didn't realize the scope of my grandmother's work until this, her death. Unfortunate, to say the least, but it has truly been incredible.

Which, I don't know, maybe softens it a little. Or makes it worse, one of the two, to know that she was loved by so many and is so suddenly <em>gone</em>.

As far as this stage of life is concerned (yeah, I'm going to go there), it seems like we can only cope by acclimation. Give it time, survive for a few months/years and gradually forget how much it hurt. But I don't understand how anyone can deal with <em>life</em> without seeing something after it.

.. No, I take it back. I can understand. Just makes life that much more valuable, right? Carpe diem while we still can. The days only last for so long.

So maybe it's just me, maybe I'm overreacting. Going to go out on a limb here and say that, given the circumstances, I'm allowed to suspend my usual existential despair and try to focus on what hope is left.

But regardless, life goes on. It's Wednesday.",exigraff wp_posts.csv

Been a while, yeah? Since I've actually spoken, I mean. As you've no doubt observed, all of these stuffs have been moved to a new domain (<em>A new domain, a new you!</em>), which happens every so often. Probably connected to some astronomical cycle. There is no great significance to this; expect the usual photograph/musick pairings to be posted at the usual plodding rate.

But, in an effort to provide you, the doting reader, with something approaching a personal update (I understand bloggers are expected to do that), know the following.

<ul><li>I have spent an unnecessarily large amount of money on Chinese takeout, as of late.</li>
<li>A week and a half were recently spent in Superior, WI, spending time with <a href=""http://anthonyrhook.com"">Anthony</a> and his cadre. A better time I have not had in years.</li>
<li>On a related note, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/0525951113"">Daemon</a> makes for an excellent read. Or two.</li>
<li>For the moment, still employed at the Chicago Public Library. By extension, I'm still living in Chicago. Going to the same school. Giving serious thought to leaving this place, but that point is, for the moment, moot.</li>
<li>Relaxation hypnosis works. It's an abhorrent surrendering of cognition, but it works, and I appreciate it.</li>
<li>I am currently in possession of three coffeemakers, one of which was left behind by this apartment's erstwhile tenant, who apparently didn't feel like warning me that the carafe leaked very, very badly. &gt;_&gt;</li>

I will be fired on November 6th. The Department of Human Resources passed it up the chain to the Department of Compliance, and with that action the fight was over.

This is not insignificant. My work here has been my primary (read: geographically limiting) tie to this city. With this absolved, I am leaving.

My application to UW Superior was submitted last week, along with all requisite transcripts and the like. The apartment went onto Craigslist today. My dear Slavic landlady was somewhat concerned about the timing (apparently winter is a suboptimal time to move), but it'll work out. Decision's been made; the rest is just details.

Looking into a web development job (not so much dependent on location) to potentially hang on to for the next few years. (Granted, I said this about my current employment as well. It's funny, when the other two developers left this place, I'd assumed my job security had dramatically increased. Should have expected a draconian act of bureaucracy to interfere. Ah well.) I'm hopeful that this will work out.

From a professional/academic perspective, going from Chicago to a small city in northern Wisconsin is something of a strange move. Unsurprisingly, then, my motivations for this are hardly professional, or academic, and for that matter are entirely unquantifiable. (Directly, anyway; the death spiral that my gpa has launched into is painfully quantifiable, but this is more a symptom and less the cause.)

This might have something to do with the fact that I'm still young and naive, not quite resigned to spending my life flat-lining behind a desk. To that end, as my boss observed, it's probably for the best that I won't be coasting along with this organization for the next <em>x</em> years.

Though I will miss the coffee. Intelligentsia's shipping rates are absurd.

To my academic institution: I have watched the most intelligent, most talented people that I've ever met <em>languish</em> within your walls. You are my only regret.

To my coworkers and managers and everyone else that I've spent the majority of my waking hours with: I love you all, I swear. I'm sorry I'm leaving under these circumstances. I'm not angry about being fired, but I'm pissed off that I can't work alongside you anymore.

Slow Tuesday, the details of which are dull and mostly a waste of time, but I need some text down here so the site layout doesn't look off-balance. Those tuning in via feedreader, suck it.

I've discovered this alarm clock on the Android Market, which seems overly proud of itself for exploiting human sleep cycles by aurally nudging the human half an hour before s/he actually wants to wake. Supposedly this makes it easier to wake up when the alarm proper is sounded. Which seems to work, unless you sleep like a dead man. In which case, it requires an actual phone call from an admissions counselor to jar you out of what had been up until that point the best sleep you've had since who knows when. Still, it's probably for the best, as you honestly have no business skipping this class, again. No, really, stumbling in five minutes late is better than not going at all; have you /seen/ your grades?

(We learned about business leadership styles today. The class plays like a bad workplace seminar. It's worth it, if only to observe what goes into manufacturing a white-collar drone.)

Coalesced in my desk chair* around noon, accomplished roughly nothing (read: watched back-episodes of Dollhouse) until 3pm, at which point I realized I'd might as well be accomplishing nothing in a place with better atmosphere. Arrived at Intelligentsia around 3:45; the coffee's worth every second of the requisite public transportation.

I'd record the rest, but it's less exciting than the above and the aesthetic balance of this beast is already a lost cause. That, and sleep is probably in order. After the coffee's finished, yeah.

There is much to love and enjoy and there are memories to be made, to be counted and held close. And fuck if I miss any more of this.

I've been gone too long.

<strong>addendum</strong>

Yeah, I don't know why I'm being vague. This domain has been locked down further (paranoia++), and it exists solely that I might speak freely. To nobody in particular, albeit, but it's still worth something.

I'm at home just now. ""Home"", the house that my family occupies. And it is home, yeah. The depression was bad, last time I was here, and the stress from being around my family was .. very bad, couldn't keep food down for weeks. But I'm sort of better now, all around, and consciously clearing the cobwebs from my head helps. I'm alright here.

It was hard, to an extent, having the family here and having Grandma not be. I still haven't come to terms with this. My instinctual response is to get as much distance as I can between me and my family, lest this happen again. Or for when it happens again. This is by way of explanation for the original statement, up top - I'd be missing too much. And I've missed a lot already, both with the family and with my friends here (Rhinelander), in Chicago and in Superior.

Rhinelander and Superior, I sort of have an excuse. (Fucking teleport. >_>) Chicago, not so much.

.. I get this nagging, uncomfortable feeling whenever I put down what amounts to a stream of consciousness. Like you all will think less of me, having seen what actually goes on in here. This is another case (and I'm getting better at this, hah) where I have to consciously kick myself back on track.

Eleven days here, really cannot wait to get out... I have a feeling it'll be like this whenever I move from one long-term scenario to another, to some degree. Implicit obligations hanging that need to end, patterns that need to be broken, if the scope is limited to factors here. There's a handful of people here that I will miss, and some more than others. Goes both ways, again, some more than others.

... My 21st birthday will be spent moving my crap from here to Wisconsin. Funny how that works.

And I think I need to find a decent girl when I get up to Superior. :p I'm a chronically lonely bastard, which kind of gets old. (Yeah, I was surprised too.) It's unfortunate that I keep ending up close to ones who either smoke pot or are psychotic... All extremely nice, intelligent, good looking, otherwise solid prospects. Good friends, most of them. But, new environs, eh? (Alternatively, my standards need to go lower...)

<p class=""wp-caption-text"">my old apartment, more empty than usual.</p></div>

21st birthday was Wednesday, moved into my parents' basement. I sort of have a studio down here.

Also, was on the receiving end of <a href=""http://anthonyrhook.com/"">Anthony</a>'s trolling while driving north from Chicago, earlier that day. A string of frantic text messages, saying that his laptop was on the verge of meltdown and I CAN""T AFFORD A NEW LAPTOP. He emailed over what was allegedly a recording of what the fans were doing, which my phone failed to open. Gave him a call, he detailed the situation in grave tones, uploaded the audio file to his website and sent over a link. This did manage to download and play properly, after freeing up some space on the phone's sd card. Turned out to be what sounds like a bad DDR-esque mix of Happy Birthday. Made my day.

I'm writing this from whitebox, my primary machine. More to the point, I'm writing this from the basement, on the far end of a less than elegant network.

The dsl modem (could be worse) is sitting in another building entirely, and is connected to a D-Link wireless router, which has a Hawking signal booster attached. This signal is caught and passed on by a Hawking repeater (armed with a high-gain antenna) over here in the house. Down in the basement, my laptop serves as a glorified network bridge - it's connected to the network broadcast by the repeater, and relays the packets to/from this connection to its ethernet port (<a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Internet/ConnectionSharing#Ubuntu Internet Gateway Method (iptables)"">iptables rules all</a>), which is connected to a Netgear router's uplink. (Wireless router, making a total of three wifi networks...) Whitebox is attached to this router, and thus are internets provided. It works disturbingly well.

Still, exposing whitebox to the internet at large would be impractical just now, and given the chronic uncertainty surrounding UW Superior's network, we've gone ahead and moved whitebox's primary functions to a <a href=""http://www.linode.com/"">Linode</a> VPS. This was the consensus after giving Dreamhost's PS service a trial run - while it does indeed provide a vps, it's still tied fairly tightly to their service management platform. Functional, but not the best if you need a completely independent box. Thus, Linode. Those who've used it speak of it in awe, and thus far it seems like they might have a point.

Haxxored the Wii, which has proven to be really useful. Turns out, full games can be saved to an sd card (or some sort of usb storage media), in addition to the usually touted benefits of playing burned discs and torrenting WiiWare titles.

And a savegame extracter/importer, for when Super Mario's restrictions get in the way.

Not sure yet if I miss Chicago. Or how that works. Transitioning is something that's historically come with relative ease. (Not counting preliminary second-guessing, which sucks.) City to city, it is what it is and there isn't a whole lot of difficulty with that, after it's done. Taking it as a good sign that it's not bothering me that I left.

2010-01-12 10:49:03,Fanboy Genius,"<em>A former co-worker forwarded me an opinion piece from Boy Genius Report: <a href=""http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2010/01/09/google-android-personal-thoughts/"">Google Android Personal Thoughts</a>. Read this before going further, or just skip this entry entirely. My response to the article follows here, which I'm posting here at others' behest.</em>

His statement that Android is missing an element of human warmth: .. okay, sure. I'm sorry that using this os doesn't make you feel warm and fuzzy inside, and that the Android phone doesn't carry with it an aura personally imbued by Steve Jobs. This is not objective.

Someone corrected him on the icons rant, fortunately. This would be a solid case of user error, and throws some of his competency into question. It's anecdote-against-anecdote, but I've had touch events misfire perhaps once. Could easily have something to do with the hardware at that point.

Regarding the lack of ""beautiful"" applications. Ignoring for a moment that the SDK has only been out since August 2008, making judgments on an operating system based on applications written by 3rd party developers is complete and utter bs.
<blockquote>Why does the VNC application I bought and paid for crash on the Nexus One with a Java.IO error? Because your entire OS is fragmented, poorly driven, poorly policed, and because in typical Google fashion, you’re already on to the next thing before making this an absolutely flawless experience for users.</blockquote>
VNC: because you bought an application from some idiot developer who doesn't know what he's doing. Google's objective is not to police the entire experience, and here be the difference between Android and the iPhone os. Android is about letting whoever wants to make whatever the hell they want out of it. The iPhone (and everything else that Apple has ever touched) is strictly policed, to use this guy's description, lest anything pollute this hallowed ground.

Though I am curious as what exactly he means by the os being ""fragmented"". I'm hoping he's referring to (again) the interface and available applications, not the actual os, as he would here be making a mistake. As observed, the coders at Google are exceedingly good at what they do.
<blockquote>What happened to ferociously making sure the absolute core applications in your package were 100% perfect before shipping? BlackBerry’s email application is flawless. Apple’s web browser is flawless. But there’s not a single application on Android that doesn’t have carbon spots in it. (Look it up)</blockquote>
Because Google's vested interest is not in the applications. (With the exception of Gmail, Maps, Chat, Voice, and the others - all of which are exceedingly solid apps.) They build the os. In a handful of cases, they also step in and work on the experience itself - see the Nexus One.

+1 Elitism for using 'carbon spots', and +1 again for being sufficiently condescending that you feel it necessary to tell the reader to look it up. It's a mistake to imply that Apple's corpus of software is without such flaws. It is true that they focus heavily on polish and veneer before shipping - this is simply what they do, and it is integral to their process. Google, not so much. This is why Gmail was released as a clearly flawed beta, back in the day - brilliant software with a couple dim spots can still be hugely beneficial for a user with a modicum of intelligence, and thus does Google make it available to the user before it's completely finished. Different ways of doing business. As a user, you can choose to live within a glossy white box with rounded corners, or .. not, really. There are less closed options of equal or greater quality/functionality, but yeah, out here not everything has been rubbed down by Steve Jobs' exacting vision.
<blockquote>Here’s another issue on why for the foreseeable future Android won’t be anything like what Apple or another company can offer: coders aren’t designers. It’s really as simple as that and anyone in the business will know exactly what I’m talking about. That’s why Apple’s entire developer ecosystem is different, because believe it or not, Apple’s developers are amazing designers that make beautiful things, and they happen to know how to code. That’s entirely different from someone who’s the best coder in the world and trying to create something that looks, works, and feels great. And so, this is my issue with Android and why you won’t see applications of iPhone-quality on Android aside from any SDK and programming hurdles.</blockquote>
Coders aren't designers. Agreed. Thus, Apple <em>hires</em> designers. Their brand dictates that every single product display the same aesthetic, so yeah, if their developers create something new, the designers are going to be working on it with equal effort. Google isn't in the business of making beautiful things. Google makes systems that allow people to get things done, and that applies with Android. You can write whatever the hell you want for the thing. The iPhone's app store is <em>moderated</em>, and this is why they have the applications that they do. Android Market is indeed more like a free market, and functions as such - the operative ideas here are completely different.

The point of Android is not to offer up an open source implementation of the iPhone os. If that's what you expect, then yeah, you'll be disappointed. Please move on; your Jobs pinup needs some love and we're working here.

... sigh. It's the internet, fanboys will have their say. Are they completely wrong, probably not. Are they lacking some objectivity, yeah. In boatloads. Then again, the consumer is not objective, and will be rendering judgment based on who they themselves are and the way they think. The Android vs iPhone situation is not dissimilar to Ubuntu vs OSX. It's not a 1:1 situation, but a lot of the core differences (heh) are present. If you're happy in your glowing Apple-branded bubble, then fine, there's a whole industry out there that'll be more than pleased to make sure you never turn around.

The Ubuntu Netbook Remix works almost perfectly out of the box on an EeePC 1005PE (screen brightness controls are a little iffy), but only comes in a 32bit edition. The 1005PE is stocked with the Atom N450, which is in fact a 64bit processor. And a fairly new one, which is probably why, upon booting the 64bit release of Ubuntu 9.10, I discovered that the keyboard and trackpad were completely unresponsive. A little odd, as at least the keyboard worked during installation.

The fix for this was fairly simple, and may be a nonissue in the near future - reboot the machine, and as GRUB loads, hit the escape key, and boot into recovery mode. Drop down to a root terminal with networking (you'll want a wired network connection for this), and run <code>aptitude update && aptitude install linux-backports-modules-karmic && aptitude safe-upgrade</code>. Then, reboot. Keyboard and mouse should be functional - go ahead and log in.

I'll bend over backwards for you, open my wallet and do whatever I can for you with complete disregard for self. This is selfless by definition, yeah, and on the other end people seem to like it.

2010-07-12 19:25:53,Avoiding the Windows Tax,"Short version: order from Amazon, and if the manufacturer won't issue a refund after your purchase, you stand a decent chance of receiving a goodwill refund from Amazon itself.

Long version:

The machine in question was a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00322PYZO"">ASUS Eee PC Seashell 1005PE-PU17-BK</a> ($368.59 at the time of purchase), along with a 2GB stick of memory ($43.99). Grand total with shipping: $420.56. The netbook (great little machine, by the way) comes with Windows 7 Starter Edition, which is a joke in every respect. What if I <em>want</em> to change my desktop wallpaper?

A quick search will give you a number of stories in which users have squared their collective shoulders and gone up against the manufacturer, arguing with ""Jonathan"" until both he and his manager tire of the game and award the battle-worn caller their prize. Not being terribly excited by this prospect, I started with the seller, Amazon:
<blockquote>Hello,

I received my EeePC from Amazon.com today, and while in the process of getting it set up was asked to accept a Microsoft Windows license agreement. For many reasons I am unable to accept the licensing terms, and thus, per the agreement itself (http://i.imgur.com/Vs308.jpg), I would like to find out how to go about returning the operating system, or receiving a refund for it. In lieu of Windows, I will be installing Linux as an os. Could you inform me of the procedure for expediting a refund?

For reference, the EULA ID for the packaged version of Windows is Win7_RM.1_STR_OEM_en-us. There is also a Microsoft Service Agreement, marked as updated September 2008. I have not and do not intend to accept either of these agreements.

Thanks for your time,

Isaac Bowen</blockquote>
The response from Amazon was prompt and helpful, if somewhat misguided.
<blockquote>I'm sorry to hear that the operating system for the personal computer you ordered is defective. I'm not able to replace or refund for individual pieces from a set, but I'll replace the set for you. Once you've received it, please ship back the original set.

The quickest way to get the part you need is to contact the manufacturer and get it directly from them under the terms of their warranty.</blockquote>
The rep went on to list contact information for ASUS, and a link to let Amazon know how the manufacturer responded. Also, the following three options, should ASUS fail to respond:
<blockquote>1. We will replace the entire set at no charge
2. If you prefer to keep the item we will refund 20% off the purchase price of this item
3. You may return the entire set for a full refund.</blockquote>
I sent an email to ASUS, saying more or less what I had said to Amazon (namely that I'd like to keep the machine, but I have no interest in using this Windows license that you've so kindly included), and waited for a month, not expecting much but knowing that Amazon had my back regardless. Happily, I received no response.

Amazon issued a full 20% refund for the netbook itself in a matter of hours, totaling $73.72. (Though, oddly, the refund notice divided the total evenly between the memory and the netbook. Why, I do not know.)

Conclusion: if you want to get your Windows tax refunded, order through someone like Amazon who can afford to throw you a bone to keep you happy. Your mileage may vary, but if the manufacturer doesn't pull through, Amazon (probably) will.",isaacbowen wp_posts.csv

Gatekeeper is built on <a href=""http://cakephp.org/"">CakePHP</a>, using an extension of Shopify's <a href=""http://github.com/Shopify/shopify_php_api"">official PHP api</a> (to be released in the near future as a Cake component - leave a comment if you're anxious).

<h3>––verbose</h3>
This project started out as a value-add for a client who maintains a Shopify storefront. They were looking for a way to lock down a single page of their store, such that only users who had a valid username could enter. Shopify does offer password protection, but it's applied globally - the store is either completely locked, or completely open. Thus, Gatekeeper.

Implementation was somewhat less than straightforward. There are no provisions for local scripting in Shopify, and because <a href=""http://www.liquidmarkup.org/"">Liquid</a> is sanely designed it does not provide access to arbitrary HTTP query data (so no POST/GET vars, let alone any session identifiers). This meant that the role that the Shopify storefront could play was limited at best. The solution I arrived at, and what is in production now, involves <a href=""http://api.shopify.com/metafield.html"">metafields</a> set on the requested resource (currently implemented for pages/products) and on the shop itself to control whether or not the resource should be delivered from Shopify, or retrieved from Gatekeeper. If the resource is locked, Javascript is used to pull the requested data from Gatekeeper's domain (necessitating JSONP). This data is only delivered if an authenticated user session is active - if not, a login form is returned, which points back to Gatekeeper.

This obviously means that Gatekeeper must actively maintain a cache of resource data, which it does. This same cache powers the lists of resources (again, just pages and products for now) that are offered to the user from the Gatekeeper dashboard, and is regularly validated and renewed. This allows Gatekeeper to capably handle thousands of resources per shop while keeping the user experience responsive, and keeping api calls to a minimum.

Gatekeeper spent exactly three weeks in the approval process. Dennis Theisen handled its review, and provided surprisingly practical and insightful feedback throughout. I'm thoroughly impressed with the level of care that Shopify gives to the user experience, even as it extends beyond Shopify to third-party applications. The <a href=""http://apps.shopify.com/"">App Store</a> is a walled garden, yes, but close communication throughout makes this a benefit, not a hindrance.

Partly a chance for her to get a few decent photos taken, partly for me to put <a href=""http://imaging.nikon.com/products/imaging/lineup/digitalcamera/slr/d3100/spec.htm"">a new camera</a> through its paces, we headed out to Superior's <a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?q=wisconsin+point+superior&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=sf2vTOuuMY7GM4WHtaoK&amp;sll=46.699662,-92.001579&amp;sspn=0.000000,0.000000&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;view=map&amp;geocode=FY6UyAId1SqE-g&amp;split=0&amp;iwloc=A&amp;ved=0CBMQpQY&amp;sa=X"">Wisconsin Point</a>.

I generally stick to environmental photography, and thus I'd never really done a formal photoshoot. I hastily scratched out a list of shots I wanted to get and the locations to get them in, but with no real experience in directing live subjects, I wasn't completely sure what to expect. Or what to <em>do</em>, really.

Things I learned, as an amateur:
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Keep it loose.</strong> Formality is boring. Natural movement and posturing is everything, so give your subject enough room to be comfortable within the bounds of your direction.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Tell me a story.</strong> The best candid portraits happen when the subject is completely ignoring you, and has their mind on something totally different. (Surprise.) The most effective method I found for this was to have Brittany tell me a story, something notable from last week, or even a scene from The Office. Or several scenes from The Office.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Let me tell <em>you</em> a story.</strong> You've just ducked around the corner, and you're hiding from someone - try to see if you're being followed, without being seen. Alternatively, you're a professional model who takes herself far too seriously.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Plan for colors.</strong> We nailed this one, actually. Bring changes of clothing with a range of colors and patterns, bearing in mind the general location you'll be shooting in. I say ""general"", because it's important to --</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Explore.</strong> The only place I had planned for was one stretch of beach. And the lighthouse. And we didn't even do the lighthouse.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Use the environment.</strong> People don't go out by old barns and pose next to classic cars of their own impetus. Someone might be expected play in the sand on the beach, though.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Shoot in RAW.</strong> Do it. Even if Lightroom <a href=""http://forums.adobe.com/message/3165900"">doesn't yet have native support for your camera's implementation</a>. &gt;_&gt;</p>
The full photoset is <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/isaacbowen/sets/72157625117549324"">here, on Flickr</a>, and is roughly 2/3 complete. Turns out, I spend a lot of time in post.

2011-04-28 15:25:07,Teach frameworks in school.,"English language classes teach the five-paragraph essay, math classes teach proof structure, and marketing classes teach inventive techniques for lying. (Kidding.) But I have yet to see a single CS professor teach any kind of framework, let alone any actual architectural/design patterns beyond some vague mumbling about separating your middleware.

This is a problem. Teaching the tools without teaching technique, ignoring the vast majority of progress made in development practices to date, is tantamount to having an intern build a cargo plane using balsa and a model of the Wright flyer for reference. It's flagrantly irresponsible.

I'm a web developer, for context, and a relatively young one at that. Just about to finish extracting a BS degree from this university. Like many of my peers, I picked up the bulk of my knowledge online - started with liberally-applied tables on Bravehost (which apparently is still around), hacked out the basics of CRUD by reading php.net, etc etc. But it wasn't until I started in on the Zend framework that the quality of my code started to seriously improve. Sure, I had already developed a relatively consistent coding style, but the structure of my software still wasn't anything transcendent, and ""code reuse"" still meant sifting through phpclasses.org. Using a framework meant that I could learn by example, at the pace of my own discovery. This is something that academia has totally failed to provide.

Obviously, I can speak only of my own experience. I've taken development courses at both the Illinois Institute of Technology and UW Superior. While I've been occasionally surprised at the caliber of the faculty at both universities, and while both will provide the aspiring developer with a solid grounding in CS fundamentals, they do little to nothing to prepare the student for actual, real-world development <em>done well</em>.

The emphasis here is important. Sure, my capstone project at UWS involves creating a tiered web application. Yes, we were told how the stack should probably be separated. But making the students start from nothing ensures that the final product will only be as good as <em>the students'</em> sum efforts, and their efforts alone. This is pointless, and a waste of the students' time. We are capable of more. We can build a functional product faster by using PHP rather than C, sure, but we can build a <em>better</em> product by allowing ourselves one more abstraction out of the gate: a framework.

In talking with my professors, it seems that the hesitation in bringing such demons into play (besides the fact that they just don't know them) lies in the initial opacity of the system. Run <code>rails new</code>, and what do you get? Skeletons! No <em>guts</em> that the students can read, line by line, and somehow assimilate in one gradual pass. This is nonsense. You don't learn to drive a car by pouring over blueprints for the powertrain. Understanding the mechanics will help you improve your mileage and preserve your investment, sure, but that's not where you start.

I'm not suggesting we ignore the language fundamentals and throw the 101 students straight into MVC (or what have you). I <em>am</em> suggesting that we merge the two.

A programming course starts with <code>printf(""Hello world"");</code>, and it should. It's not impenetrable to the uninitiated, and in teaching it we assume that their brains can wrap around a function call without first having deep understanding of what a function is. My point is that there's little difference between this, and starting one level higher. Now, we see <code>echo(""Hello world"");</code>, but it's given context - this code is a ""view"", and it talks to the user. The fundamentals may still be taught with equal efficacy, but now they are accompanied by <em>structure</em>, something that the students can pick up gradually as a concept integral to development, and not just a good idea to tack on towards the end.

(I should probably clear some ambiguity here before I get any flack for it. There is a distinction to be made between computer science, such as it is, and software development. The pure CS (read: math) that I got out of my degree is great, and in retrospect I should have focused more on it, but I entered college with the idea that I was going to build tools that were going to help people. It took far too much time for me to discover that this wasn't going to happen within the confines of academia. Perhaps this is a greater problem than the one I've been railing on about here - the total lack of any declared distinction between academic and applied computer science. Other schools may be better with this, but I know I'm not the only one who was screwed by IIT on this point.)

Ultimately, my concern is with the potential of students. There's a reason why calculus is introduced in high school now instead of being sequestered away in college - when given the proper support over time, kids can handle it. And by acquiring a deeper understanding of mathematics earlier on, they are that much better equipped to make progress faster. Wasted time is just sad, especially when students have <em>no idea</em> there's a better way.

So - teach frameworks in school. Do everyone a favor.",isaacbowen wp_posts.csv
2011-06-11 13:13:55,Dual-dual-booting Ubuntu and Windows,"<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<strong>Yes, Virginia, there is a way to boot your physical Ubuntu (or whatever) partition as a VirtualBox machine from within Windows. With port forwarding, no less.</strong>

<h2>Background</h2>

Last week I took receipt of a Dell XPS 15z. Intel Core i7-2620M, NVIDIA GeForce GT525M with Optimus (for switching between integrated and dedicated graphics), 8GB of DDR3 memory. Which is fantastic. The chassis does resemble that of a Macbook Pro, and its keyboard is straight out of The Jetsons, but on the whole it's a <em>nice</em> machine.

The issue is that Ubuntu 11.04 still doesn't have solid support for the i7, let alone Optimus. Not to mention the Cypress Semiconductor trackpad, which I got working <em>once</em> after restarting to test an NVIDIA driver. As it stands, I'm now able to boot Ubuntu by using the <code>acpi=off</code> flag, if I'm willing to sacrifice three of my four cores, power management, dedicated graphics, and my trackpad. I have every confidence that <em>eventually</em> I'll have everything working, but for now, I need a little more than this.

Enter VirtualBox. A friend (who shalt remain nameless) has started running his various unix-like instances as VMs under a Windows host, which he loves - full, tuned hardware support for the host, and everything that Ubuntu and OSX need to operate virtually. Still, the idea of creating a virtual machine and virtual disk drive for Ubuntu, while keeping my actual Ubuntu partition separate, was unpleasant (ignoring for a moment my intense dislike for Windows as a whole). And while a couple people have written up tutorials for booting a physical partition in a VM, they were all dated <=2008. And so, good reader, I give you this:

<h2>Solution</h2>

Note: This assumes that you've already got Ubuntu (or similar) dualbooted with Windows, with your bootloader sitting on the Ubuntu partition. If you have a separate /home and/or swap partition, fear not.

<ol>
<li>Boot Windows. Install VirtualBox.</li>
<li>Run VirtualBox as an administrator (right-click the shortcut, click ""Run as administrator"").</li>
<li>Create a new VM (click the blue ""New"" button). Customize your heart out. Don't worry about adding any media to it just yet.</li>
<li>Open up the command prompt, again as an administrator (click Start, type <code>cmd</code>, right-click the shortcut that appears, click ""Run as administrator"").</li>
<li>Change directories to the VirtualBox program directory - probably just <code>cd ""C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\""</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>VBoxManage internalcommands listpartitions -rawdisk \\.\PhysicalDrive0</code>, where <code>0</code> is in the index of the physical drive you have Ubuntu on. This will give you a list of partitions for that drive. In my case, my boot, /home and swap partitions were 4, 5 and 6, respectively.</li>
<li>Run <code>VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename C:\Users\user\VirtualBox VMs\ubuntu.vmdk -rawdisk \\.\PhysicalDrive0  -partitions 4,5,6</code>, where <code>4,5,6</code> are <strong>all</strong> of the partitions used by Ubuntu, and <code>C:\Users\user\VirtualBox VMs\ubuntu.vmdk</code> is the full path of the file you want to create to represent the Ubuntu partitions. Doesn't really matter where you put it, as long as you know where it is.</li>
<li>Open up the settings for the VirtualBox VM you created earlier. In the Storage section, add the vmdk file you just created as a Hard Disk. Make sure that you also add an empty CD/DVD device - this will be used for the VirtualBox guest additions later.</li>
<li>Go back to your command prompt. For every port you need forwarded from Windows to the VM, run this: <code>VBoxManage modifyvm tank --natpf1 ""guestssh,tcp,,22,,22""</code>, where <code>tank</code> is the name of your VM (yeah, yeah), <code>guestssh</code> is the name of your forwarding rule (be logical, but this one's up to you), and <code>tcp,,22,,22</code> are respectively the protocol and host/guest ports (e.g. use <code>tcp,,8080,,80</code> to forward TCP port 8080 on Windows to port 80 on your VM).</li>
<li>If all goes well, you'll be able to start your shiny VM, load GRUB, and boot into Ubuntu. Don't forget to install the guest additions (Devices -> Install Guest Additions...).</li>
</ol>

Main caveat: whenever you run something that accesses another partition, you must run it with administrator rights. I ended up creating a shortcut directly to my VM (Machine -> Create Shortcut on Desktop) and modifying it to always start this way (right-click, Properties, Compatibility, Privilege Level, Run this program as administrator).
