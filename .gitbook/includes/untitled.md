<figure><img src="../assets/Screenshot 2024-10-31 at 12.47.42â€¯PM.png" alt="A diagram on the left, and its legend on the right. The legend reads &#x22;A = self; B = knowable other; C = unknown other; [blue] = known; [pink/blue stripes] = knowable; [pink] = unknown&#x22;. The diagram is an outlined box, separated into four equal quadrants by a centered vertical line and a centered horizontal line. Note, though: the vertical and horizontal lines each have gaps where each quadrant is open to its adjacent neighbors. The lower-left quadrant has a blue background, and is labeled &#x22;A&#x22;. The lower-right quadrant has a pink/blue striped background, and is labeled &#x22;B&#x22;. The upper-right quadrant has a pink background, and is labeled &#x22;C&#x22;. The upper-left quadrant has a pink/blue striped background, and is unlabeled."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
