I’m not fond of dreams, and would avoid them entirely if I could do so and remain sane. Tonight’s features: a simulation in which a business team was put into a structure built of large, rapidly eroding sandstone cubes, watching a train go by with thousands of sheep inside being treated not at all well, and trying to save the life of some random portly guy in the middle of an executive meeting.

Also, having the delusion that my bottom teeth were loose.

So given that I’m not really steady on my feet, allow me to point you in several _other_ directions…

**divide by zero** [fonts.tom7.com](http://fonts.tom7.com/)\
A collection of Truetype fonts that, if you’ve ever liked anything connected to Tim Burton, you will probably like.

**SuperCollider** [supercollider.sourceforge.net](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/)\
Not the song, the audio/wave synthesis server. Of course.

**Portal: The Flash Version** [portal.wecreatestuff.com](http://portal.wecreatestuff.com/)\
The guys at [wecreatestuff](http://wecreatestuff.com) (of [Nightmare House](http://nh2.wecreatestuff.com/) quasi-fame) apparently saw the demo of Portal, and saw potential for a stripped-down 2d Flash version. Heh. It’s actually quite good (but no substitute for [the real thing](http://orange.half-life2.com/portal.html)).

**On an unrelated note**, I’m seeing something of a resemblance between the iPhone’s reception (pun!) and that of the Zune. Yeah, the iPhone introduced new ([well…](http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Apple-alternatives-rival-the-iPhone/2007/10/24/1192941124957.html)) technologies, arguably more so than the Zune did. However – both were market entries for their respective companies, and the OS they shipped with did little to fulfill the hardware potential.

So there.
