# Mirror and Stone

This is also fairly old. “Old” meaning “having an age greater than one year”.

> I’m walking through a hallway,\
> And it seems an eternity long.\
> The only window is at the end,\
> And through it peers the dawn.
>
> The ceiling is all of brilliant white,\
> The floor as cold as stone.\
> Only mirrors grace these walls,\
> Leaving my reflection and I alone.
>
> I don’t know how I got here,\
> I can’t remember when.\
> No idea how to escape here,\
> Or when I’ll find the end.
>
> So for now I’m forced to continue on,\
> At the threat of standing still.\
> Only mirrors stay by my side,\
> Only showing an empty shell.
>
> An empty shell is all that’s left,\
> Feels like the rest has drained away.\
> There was nothing of value to keep it there,\
> No reason why it should stay.
>
> And on I walk through an eternity,\
> My reflection and I alone,\
> Without any hope of any escape\
> From a hall of mirror and stone.
