[the dumbfound game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKdHFP5xJ0) (fair)

you say you won't be fooled again\
without a simple please\
you drug me there and back and then\
you tried to make your peace

it's just a simple mistake\
tomorrow I won't relate\
I only wonder if the question remains

_can someone show me how to feel?_\
_take heart, be still_\
_forget this ringing in my ears_\
_breathe deep, be here_

a brother makes a sacrifice\
I hope the pulpit sees\
but in your debt you can't decide\
another violent seed

it's always the same\
I'm playing the dumbfound game\
it's as if I couldn't see\
the callous I've come to be

can someone show me how to feel?\
take heart, be still\
forget this ringing in my ears\
breathe deep, be here
