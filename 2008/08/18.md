# 20080818

Moved in. Largely.

I brought my piano, and I'm hopinghopinghoping that I can use it. Actually use it, not just tinker with it. Haven't been able to write anything of any caliber for a very long time. My grasp of the keyboard (for lack of a better term) is still good, my fingers still work. Just no... spark. thing. :/
