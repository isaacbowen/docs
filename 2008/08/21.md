I had my first flying dream a few nights ago. Meaning a dream in which I was actually able to attain flight myself, in contrast to the recurring ones from the past. You may or may not recall.

But - I was in flight. First time ever for a dream, which was kinda cool, actually.

So, I burned a house and killed the man inside.

And my teeth kept coming loose. I'd touch them, pull a little, and out they'd come, with roots an inch long.

.. yeah, I... yeah.
