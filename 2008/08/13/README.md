Some people mean the world to me.

Some people mean at least three continents.

I make friends easily. When it's needed, when it's appropriate. Sometimes it seems like they learn to care about me faster than I develop similar sentiments in their direction. Sometimes it's the other way, and their worth in relative landmass is greater by my books. To extend an awkward analogy.

Sometimes it seems like the person with the bigger heart, whoever they are, is wasting their time.

I'm so tired....

(For those who would rank me anywhere above Africa, please make sure I never start an alcohol habit. Thank you.)

_addendum_

I assume most of you are stable enough to not be concerned for whatever connection we may or may not have. Please don't. If you're reading this at all, you probably know what's what.
