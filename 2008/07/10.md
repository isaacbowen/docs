_if it can be understood, it can be controlled_

_that's how I live_

I sorta want to shave my head. Only thing is the vitiligo - if half of my cranium is a different shade than the other half, it could look strange.

Also considering two tattoos, one on each inner forearm, something like two inches up from the wrist. A black rectangle, golden ratio, lengthwise in line with the arm, roughly 1x5/8".

Note from the future: [I did get that tattoo](../../2017/08/23.md). :)
