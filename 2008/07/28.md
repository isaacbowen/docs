I miss singing.

Is that weird?

Not that it matters.

I used to be able to write music. Get stuff out into the open that way.

Actually, the reality is probably that my ability to write is right where it was at the beginning, and I didn't realize that it sucked until now.

Not all of it, granted. Some of it didn't suck.

Whatever, point is that I'm out of new ideas, and I don't know where they went.
