Alright. I'm calm again. I apologize to you and myself for yesterday. And I recant the lines that basically said no one has ever hugged me.

... sigh.

At work. Shoving Pantone down Publisher's throat. (Coat check.)

Five years came today, and I hate making a fool of myself. I hate realizing that I've been such, and will probably continue to be. I hate knowing that what I feel the most strongly... doesn't mean anything.
