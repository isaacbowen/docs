Happy weekend. Having achieved consciousness, I'm off to get more frozen pizza.

_'Return, O faithless sons,' declares the Lord; 'For I am a master to you, And I will take you one from a city and two from a family, And I will bring you to Zion.'_

I don't know why this caught my attention. Jeremiah 3:18. It's sort of been nagging at me for months. _One from a city and two from a family._ Still trying to figure out why this has my attention.
