{% hint style="info" %}
Recovered from an installation of [Textpattern](https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern) on whitefacade.com. It's 2024 now and wow I would not choose that domain name again, lol. I guess I also used ikeemo.com before those? No memory of that.

Entry one. I am changing locations. The switch affords me a little more flexibility. Textpattern ftw, though Tumblr was nice while it lasted. You can still look up the old stuff at reverse(moc.omeeki), if you want. Not going to bother importing it.

Have a nice day.
