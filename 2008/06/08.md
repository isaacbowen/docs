Apparently I have nothing better to do than sit by a lake and.. actually, no, apparently I have nothing better to do than drive a few miles to town, crawl at 2mph around the lake until I find an open network, find a tree within range and sit down with my laptop, so that while I wait for anyone to contact me I'll at least be able to hit refresh every few seconds to see if anyone else has read this.

Laame.
