This stuff probably shouldn't be posted out here..

***

I have no interest in living. As of this moment, I have no aspirations or goals. No interest. My friends and family are the only thing left, I guess. I don't want to hurt them and I don't want to lose them.

It's all so fricking textbook. And all of this can be changed with a pill.

I _hate_ that.

_you're killing me, killing me_
