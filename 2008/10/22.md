I can't think anymore, you know. My mind is muddled and my intellect is dull.

This is a problem. Academically, partly, and I think it bodes ill for the new job. This is going to be a steep learning curve, and I'm very afraid that I'm not going to be able to keep up.

Going to try, nonetheless... This is the job that my 'normal', so-called, self would thrive in. Currently, I'd rather work in a call center. Or data entry. Or something monotonous and not cognitively demanding. I don't have the mind power for something like this ==_gestures_== right now.

Gots bills to pay.
