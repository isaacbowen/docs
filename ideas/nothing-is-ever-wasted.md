# Nothing is ever wasted

Not everything that emerges _comes_ from somewhere important. But everything will be used and addressed in time, _and it is not your job_ to see that process through. Pick up and keep the pieces that you want to hold and carry; let the rest go, knowing that they will follow their own paths of experience. The All will benefit from the experiences of everyone involved. It's okay. :)
