_but the struggle between frost and the force in running water is not quickly over. the battle fluctuates, and at the point of fluctuation between the motion in water and the immobility of frost, strange and beautiful forms are evolved --_ [_Nan Shepherd_](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/25/nan-shepherd-first-woman-scottish-bank-note)

* There is enough detail at every level for a meaningfully rich life
* One can zoom in and zoom out, remaining at any level for any amount of time, without experiencing any loss (or gain) in overall meaning or detail
* Unconscious movement through the fractal is created as life asymptotically approaches a state of complete rest -- we seek relief, eternally, getting meaningfully closer in new ways without ever reaching it
  * This movement can be resisted, by attempting to jump from one point on the curve to the next without following it _inwards_
