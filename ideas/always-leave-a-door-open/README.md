# Always leave a door open

Pretty sure this leads to [recursively open doors](recursively-open-doors.md), btw.

## For people

I'd like to say "assume nothing about each other", but to speak any language at all requires some assumption. (Even if it's the assumption that the other person can _hear_.) We have to make _some_ assumptions about what we're up for, but always leave a door open for someone to say "hey, I want something else".

## For product

When making a product, ensure that it is _at its core_ infinitely reconfigurable, infinitely flexible, in such a way that a configuration of the product can work around limitations in the product itself.

[Tripartite systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem) are great for this. (Locksmith has locks, keys, and key conditions; Mechanic has events, tasks, and actions.)
