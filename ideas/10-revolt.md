# 10% revolt

For any given population (of people, of ideas, of machines, whatever), at any given moment 10% must be in open revolt for the organism of the whole to experience long-term health and vitality.

That population has its own 10%. It's hard to _be_, down there. At the same time, where better to keep the secrets for future life? :)
