# Consciously bounded awareness

This is linked to [relying on intuition](living-by-informed-intuition.md). It seems useful, viable, to find and establish and maintain a line, beyond which I purposefully do not go looking. It's like how I don't collect user data whatsoever about our apps. No demographics, no heatmaps, no nothing. I removed Google Analytics years ago. We're doing better than ever.

Traversing those lines is called transconsciousness, maybe.
