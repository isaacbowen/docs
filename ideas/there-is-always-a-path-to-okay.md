# There is always a path to "okay"

Can't ignore external state. Can't guarantee what would happen if I fought it.

Only thing I can even slightly control is my own action.

Therefore, the most direct path to being okay, averaged out over all time, is via my own chosen action in full acceptance of what's true around me. Not even a little resistance. Getting back to okay is always the priority, and resistance slows me down.
