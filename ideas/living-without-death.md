# Living without death

The original thought here was "Living as if reincarnation was a thing, regardless of whether or not it is". This is too long for a title, and it's also too specific: reincarnation is just one model that allows one to get beyond the fear of death, and there are others!

The core idea is that one's life becomes far more effective (to oneself, _and also_ to everyone around) if one lives without the idea that death is coming. However you get there (and I'm not sure it matters), assuming some kind of persistence is useful. Not for the sake of what that persistence looks like, but because of what the very _assumption_ frees you to do with the life you have now.
