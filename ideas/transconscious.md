# Transconscious

From [20240506](../2024/05/06.md):

> Maybe the single most helpful transition I've been through is this transconscious one: shifting the boundaries of the _self_ that I consider to be associated with my consciousness. And, in doing so, allowing my consciousness to exist with fuzzy borders, allowing it to seep into whatever spaces it will, and to sense and engage with other forms of consciousness. Other "selves" of their own, I guess.
