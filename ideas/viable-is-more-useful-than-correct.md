# Viable is more useful than correct

Correlary: All anyone ever works toward is [effectiveness](../2023/11/17/ai-makes-everybody-effective.md).

If nothing else, art viably creates experience, and that's useful. Art doesn't have to be correct, it just has to create an experience. I think of everything I do and make and think as art. All we have is experience. All I have to make is art.
