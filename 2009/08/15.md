I’m beginning to think emotion exists in discreet quantities. Every soul has a hard limit.

To that end, I appear to have met mine. I think that’s why I haven’t been able to eat, actually. Hoping that passes with acclimation.

Trying really hard to keep level-headed about this. Writing helps.

Really fricking glad anthony/I got to see each other this week. Just wish the distance wasn’t so great 99.99% of the time. Still though, 0.01% is worth it.

Dad: “But what matters most is that you’re happy. Because… if you are, so are we.” They’re not, of course, but I’m trying my best to cover… Remember why I’m here this week. This is hard, harder than I expected.
