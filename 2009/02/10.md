Do listen to this. It is worth your time.

I've largely moved into the new apartment, making do at present with a desk/pc, piano/barstool, futon, filing cabinet and a coffee table that the previous tenant left behind. Also some lights from Ikea that I had hanging about. I'm unaccustomed to ending the day in a quiet place, and I think this apartment will do well.

Until July. It's a short lease, and the second bedroom will be filled for the final three or four months. The tentative plan is to keep expenses down for the time being, rebuild my savings, and move again in the summer. Find a decent single-bedroom somewhere, move in with a cat. Live unremarkably, work and classes and whatever else presents itself as necessary.

I've been making a conscious effort to simplify things, cut down on the relative melange I'm wading through. Inasmuch as I'm able; some of it's unavoidable. This being America (uh-MER-ca) and all.

More music (e.g. things recorded from my piano) is coming. I have some pieces in my head, still working them together.

... So this post was atypically downtempo. Or not, maybe; whatever verbiage has managed to make it online has been leaning in this direction. Apparently blathering on in overly mellow tones is what I do now. You should probably go read [something](http://dilbert.com/blog) [else](http://dresdencodak.com).
