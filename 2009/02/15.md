Inspiration and credit for this comes from [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5152819/to+dos-weather-and-twitter-on-a-linux-desktop) and [this guy](http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=5429878\&postcount=66).

**you will need these**

Perspective Sans ([dafont.com](http://www.dafont.com/perspective-sans.font), installation guide at [wiki.ubuntu.com](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Fonts#Manually))\
conky ([sourceforge.net](http://conky.sourceforge.net/), [aptitude](apt://conky))\
python, with urllib and feedparser ([aptitude](apt://python), [aptitude](apt://python-urljr) and [aptitude](apt://python-feedparser))\
weather ([fungi.yuggoth.org](http://fungi.yuggoth.org/weather/), [aptitude](apt://weather-utli))\
gnome-do ([gnomedo.com](http://gnomedo.com), [aptitude](apt://gnome-do))\
Dust theme ([wiki.ubuntu.com](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Incoming/DustTheme#Download), includes install guide)\
wallpaper, conky rc's and gmail script ([themage.tar](http://exigraff.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/themage.tar), wallpaper artist is [benedict campbell](http://www.benedict1.com/), who is [insane](http://www.benedict1.com/PAGES/digital-cyber%20future.html))

**basically do this**

Install the font and all packages named above, also the Dust theme (non-Ubuntufolk, I do apologize, but you're on your own). Download themagetar.gz, extract to your home directory (e.g. /home/username/, or \~/). Presumably you can handle setting the wallpaper.

Conky will run the system info panel out of the box (after changing your gmail acct/password info in .conkyrc, and assuming you have python and weather set up correctly) - just run \`conky\` from a terminal.  Run \`conky -c \~/.conkyrc2\` to get the clock going. To make this run automatically when you log in, open up the Sessions app (System -> Preferences -> Sessions, \`gnome-session-properties\`, or use gnome-do! ctrl+space) and add \`conky & conky -c \~/.conkyrc2\` as a startup item.

I have gnome-do running in Docky mode - instructions on setting that up [are here](http://do.davebsd.com/wiki/index.php?title=Docky).

You'll note that there is no gnome-panel visible here. There actually is one on the bottom edge of the screen, set to autohide. Should you attempt something similar, you can use gconf-editor to make the panel slide offscreen completely (e.g. not leaving a bit of it visible as a visual cue). From a terminal, run \`gconf-editor\` and navigate to /apps/panel/toplevels/(panel name, mine is top\_panel\_screen0). Ensure 'auto\_hide' is checked, and change 'auto\_hide\_size' to 0. Close.

And I think that's it... Oh, you may or may not want to use the Dust theme as-is here. I've modified my copy to be greyscale, which works well. As I haven't bothered to repackage it nicely, you can download it [here](http://isaacbowen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/duststar.gz) (dump in \~/.themes and set your theme to Greyscale Dust (available in the Appearances app).

Let me know if you have any questions; this wasn't a terribly in-depth guide. More of a here-are-some-things-maybe-try-them post than a guide. I fully expect no more than two people to make use of any of this, but still. Ask away.

**oh, hang on**

If you have issues with conky flickering (despite double\_buffer being turned on), try adding 'Load "dbe"' to the Module section of your xorg.conf. Might take care of it.
