# destiny

“the world gets better”, fast forward, “heaven” is your narrative horizon

“the world gets worse”, fast forward, “hell” is your narrative horizon

“the world is a process”, time gets _extremely_ slippery here, the world is its own narrative horizon, like a simpsons episode putting its own context back where you found it

“the world changes”, time is no longer a stable concept, have fun

I think that last one might be why Borges saw heaven as a library. fast forward, a-path-to-anything-and-back is your narrative horizon
