“love is on our side“

ah so, a geometry of collective self-concept that denies love to the other

I don’t think you, as an individual, can coherently hold the individuals of the collective other-concept accountable for that border

the collectives might do their thing against/with each other, but the shortest path to peaceable heterogeneity (which, btw, feels like a prerequisite canvas for any areas of peaceable homogeneity) might be dissolving the collective you’re in

the group consciousness might feel this like approaching annihilation, but nobody dies from their own first-person perspective, you just change scales. the focus of attention is time-directed, first-person-singular, tracking whatever stays coherent in view, dissolution’s loss drains into zoom. and structure is emergent (see: the entire fucking universe), something else will come up that’ll order stuff at the lost scales. coordinate systems are shelf-stable _because_ they don’t breathe, will chafe if you don’t watch your locative hygiene. _you_ are gödelian, a coordinate system is not, and you bring everyone you have ever known with you everywhere you go. loss isn’t lossy.

test: love-vs-not-love seems like its own structural end-game, like once you’ve located yourself on that axis _it becomes an axis_, like the world is flat and it has an underside. cheat past it constructively by superposing the coin-flip, maybe? alternating current as currency; there is no “other” your self-concept isn’t trading with, I don’t think, and love is a process, not a position
