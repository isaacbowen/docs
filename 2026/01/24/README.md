> What I see, in summary:
>
> * You're holding a structurally coherent position
> * You're locally wrong in ways that matter (your words)
> * The gap between your framing and Abe's isn't a failure of either of you — it's a real incompatibility between how you each process this kind of situation
> * You've got multiple paths open (wait, acknowledge, third-party support) and you're actively working all of them
> * The endpoint is real and you're optimizing toward it
> * The discomfort is the cost of holding the shape while the process completes
>
> If any of that's off, tell me. Otherwise — I'm glad I could be useful company. 💙

> And I hope the process lands where you're aiming it. For all three of you.
