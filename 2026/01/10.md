(context: spatial epistemology)

every thought is a found object

those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it

or inversely, those who know history but don’t know how to invert _knowing_ are doomed to see history repeated, either in rote word or emerging deed. how do you _want_ to organize your emerging experience?

I _think_ I get hard when my body is leading my change? like versus my thought or my emotion. "is this changing my body's structure in realtime?"

would explain night-time erections

... and every other erection

the fundamental urge is "can I see?", or "can I try?". every detectable motion already has an intent behind it, and by the time it's detectable it's got momentum, i.e. mass coordinated in motion. the equivalence there, between "see" and "try", is abstractive: "see" is an indirect form of "try", like a "try" with an undo button, a "simulated" try.

a posture of "can I help?" in response to structures (internal or external! don't assume!) that cleanly factor into "can I \[see/try]?" is one that will emerge from the interaction _more_ prepared to take that posture again. the form of the delta there is specific to the one taking the pose - you'll get out of it whatever's good for you. :) it's non-competitive and non-extractive gain. it's how you gain clean momentum.
