(context: spatial epistemology)

every thought is a found object

those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it

or inversely, those who know history but don’t know how to invert _knowing_ are doomed to see history repeated, either in rote word or emerging deed. how do you _want_ to organize your emerging experience?

I _think_ I get hard when my body is leading my change? like versus my thought or my emotion. "is this changing my body's structure in realtime? do I need my dick-as-dowsing-rod for this?"

this would (wood) explain night-time erections

... and every other erection, _and_ why that (self-employed, well-paid, we're-already-friends-in-other-contexts) male stripper Abe hired for us (as my Christmas present) was an enthralling and beautiful experience for me but _didn't get me physically aroused_ - it wasn't _changing_ me, we were just passing through

sexual intimacy as real-time body-led _change_ for all those involved?

_la petite mort_ as fully locating the self in the body, fully letting go of one's thought-coordinates and feeling-coordinates. post-cum clarity as being the discovery of where those positions of yours landed when you weren't looking - useful, because you looking away allowed them to move discontinuously.

***

the fundamental urge is "can I see?", or "can I try?". every detectable motion already has an intent behind it, and by the time it's detectable it's got momentum, i.e. mass coordinated in motion. the equivalence there, between "see" and "try", is abstractive: "see" is an indirect form of "try", like a "try" with an undo button, a "simulated" try.

a posture of "can I help?" in response to structures (internal or external! don't assume!) that cleanly factor into "can I \[see/try]?" is one that will emerge from the interaction _more_ prepared to take that posture again. the form of the delta there is specific to the one taking the pose - you'll get out of it whatever's good for you. :) it's non-competitive and non-extractive gain. it's how you gain clean momentum.
