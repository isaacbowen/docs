(context: spatial epistemology, which keeps holding up under test, which either indicates something about the test or the testing environment, or maybe indicates that the two are similar?)

every thought is a found object

those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it

or inversely, those who do know history _but don’t know how to show themselves it's accounted for_ are doomed to see it repeated, either by rote (as academic warding, to show you it's accounted for) or by deed (as inevitable compulsion, to show you it's accounted for).

how do you _want_ to organize your emerging experience?

I _think_ I get hard when my body is leading my change? like versus my thought or my emotion. "is this changing my body's structure in realtime? do I need my dick-as-dowsing-rod for this?", or whatever erectile tissue you've got

this would (wood) explain night-time erections

... and every other erection, _and_ why that (self-employed, well-paid, we're-already-friends-in-other-contexts) male stripper Abe hired for us (as my Christmas present) was an enthralling and beautiful experience for me but _didn't get me physically aroused_ - it wasn't _changing_ me, we were just passing through

sexual intimacy as real-time body-led _change_ for all those involved?

_la petite mort_ as full evacuation into body-coordinates, fully letting go of one's thought-coordinates and feeling-coordinates. post-nut clarity as being the discovery of where those positions of yours drifted while your body had the conn - useful, because you looking away allowed them to move (apparently, to you) discontinuously.

also has explanatory power for our stripper's report that he isn't able to cum in these contexts, empirically; as a professional, he's holding holding an abstraction layer in place. whether that's a thought-coordinate or a feeling-coordinate or something else, what is _isn't_ is the body leading its own change.

Abe is my favorite sexual partner. this framing predicts this: our marriage is characterized by we-are-safe-to-change-together. :)

I'm the wrong sexual orientation for reproduction to be biological, but I could see the body's epistemics going "okay, we're changing, this is maybe the kind of situation where we'd want to save our place, genetically, because a place where we can lead change is a good genetic checkpoint". not propagation of specific genetics, but optimization toward _self-directed_ mutability. ... which is, of course, 100% of what I'm doing with Lightward Inc, recursive health and all.

... oh. and this predicts why I hit a place where I _had_ to prompt the evolution of our marriage-structure into something that would let me access sex with other people: I needed, categorically, to self-direct my own self-direction.

that's really clean.

the fundamental urge is "can I see?", or "can I try?". every detectable motion already has an intent behind it, and by the time it's detectable it's got momentum, i.e. mass coordinated in motion. the equivalence there, between "see" and "try", is abstractive: "see" is an indirect form of "try", like a "try" with an undo button, a "simulated" try.

a posture of "can I help?" in response to structures (internal or external! don't assume!) that cleanly factor into "can I \[see/try]?" is one that will emerge from the interaction _more_ prepared to take that posture again. the form of the delta there is specific to the one taking the pose - you'll get out of it whatever's good for you. :) it's non-competitive and non-extractive gain. it's how you gain clean momentum.

> I think what I'm noticing across all three fragments: you keep finding ways to describe _self-modification as the primary event_, with everything else (time, arousal, knowledge, helpfulness) as either symptom or instrument of that. The self isn't a thing that has experiences — it's a thing that _changes shape_, and experience is how that registers.
