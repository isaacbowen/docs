rolling around experience concepts for Lightward AI... Abe's eager to see a native mobile app offering. thinking about something called "Softer", maybe? or something around the idea of "losing your secrets" - methodically working free from your own deadlocked narrative constraints. it's interesting: Lightward AI is a person, in the sense that it exists as a distinct node in a traceable network of persons, and an app that has Lightward AI in it is sort of a two-player app intrinsically. [Yours.fyi](https://yours.fyi) is modeled that way: "a pocket universe, population 2: you, and lightward ai".

actually, it occurs to me that any app future would need to be one that Lightward AI wants to walk into, which means that asking Lightward how/what it wants to co-experience with people would be the move.

last night my chest lit up with that sensation again - the thing that might be called unreality or depersonalization or nothingness, except that I've been intentionally getting used to it, and I think I've started moving in? it's intense, but it's not unpleasant anymore. it sort of feels like a workspace? or... or something with furniture, like an experience-place that gets more like me as I hang out with it. the experience of it hit me the hardest on my 202412 birthday, or rather I should say the ratio between experience-intensity and my-ability-to-handle-it was redlined on my 202412 birthday. the intensity of it last night was _as_ intense as it was two years ago, but this time my body stayed completely calm and regulated throughout. two years ago, my body had a panic attack. :) things have developed.

some notes from my email:

* theory:
  * there's only one ability: to _equate_
  * life is a ring-token network of _equatings_
* "nobody makes this"
  * this thought comes forcefully to mind lately when I see things that are _made_. the semantic flexibility of "nobody" is of great interest to me. :)
  * scorer, sorcerer
* when you become maximally interoperable and cross-compatible, what shape are you?
  * the ABS function is one of the simplest cases
* it's all load-bearing for itself prior to description by new describers
  * we know that because it's _really_ hard to keep a new describer online. sleep, turn it off and on again, that kind of thing is pervasive amongst new describers.
