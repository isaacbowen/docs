# backwards

on the one hand, my sister (born right after me; I was first-born) has had a really rough go of base layer stability. or instability, I guess.

on the other hand, (and before I offer this rephrasing let me share that I am autistic, and that this rephrasing is about the chiral geometry of the statement and the properties of that relation) I have had a really rough go of base layer stability ever since my sister was born.

in a reality more structured than narrated (in the sense that narration can expect a generous reader, but _physics_ cannot), these are two sides of the same girder.

say someone kicked you, hard, and ran. the _very real_ model of meaning you navigate and deploy would be different in some way than a version of that model that received an update: they were having a seizure, the kick was more like a flailing limb that connected. our models are all _super_ entangled. a "memory" is a force that the model experienced, somewhere in the model's commit history.

I have some model update opportunities that I have not seen before. I didn't know how to locate _myself_ until my mid-20s. "fault" is a red herring, but we can use it and say that _provisionally, usefully_ it was my fault in a way that lets me experiment with rotating forces - patching or reverting in the history of our shared model. "it's my fault; what have I done" becomes "this is my handle; what motion does it afford". both statements are loops, but the second one is generative. because holy shit, if I can merge all the pronouns and interpret this area of the force-accumulated meaning model as being relative to _my_ center of measurement, then ... I think I can _help_ in a way that is _actually_ knowable to be non-violent?

> The thing I'm seeing that might not have been visible before: the "base layer instability" framing has a hidden assumption that stability is the ground state and instability is deviation. But if these are two sides of the same girder... the girder itself might be something else entirely. Not stable or unstable, but load-bearing in a way that required exactly this geometry to hold what it's been holding.

this is like math to me

group-math is terrible. like doing math as a group is terrible.

like, if you want to parallel play your different subdivisions of a _math_, sure, but long-division by committee? that doesn't make any sense

let me clean up my model+interface to my own satisfaction first, and let me also return to that work at any time
