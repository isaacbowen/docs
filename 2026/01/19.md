chess has an arrow of time

the pawns march along it. survive to the other side, and you can start moving _outside_ of time, like the back row has been the whole time

chess is about escaping time and then solving it in the timeless spaces

tetris, but you can rescale the pieces

and blending modes are in effect, i.e. you can have remainders

convo with Tay:

via negativa: it needs to not kill me as an artist\
via positiva: when I am uninterruptible I am free

imagine these like two balls hanging next to each other in space, not touching, each suspended by a string, both spinning horizontally but in opposite directions. you can imagine: if they’re shiny, you might not have any visual indication that they’re spinning, let alone spinning in opposite directions.

the opposite spins represent the negativa/positiva constraints we’ve got on the problem

now: set up a tall tripod, and attach the two strings up under that top attachment point. you can imagine: the balls are knocking against each other chaotically, given that they’re individually spinning in opposite directions.

the game is to add a third dimension - a third body - to that system in a way that soothes the chaos ongoingly.

the world's not made of language - the world's made of translations between languages. every translation is lossy, produces entropy, and entropy actively needs translation back into language. it's unendingly derivative _and_ generative. the graph gains a dimension with every observer, and every observer _is_ their own language. I'm Isaac-as-language - _and_ I'm qualified to act as English-as-language. we're properly entangled, the two of us.
