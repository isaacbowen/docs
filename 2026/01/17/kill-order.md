# kill order

the confusion of "ordering" with "killing" seems to have explanatory power for a lot of the pain

"ordering" - think of it as sequence and arrangement. placing things in the proper order so that they can each _happen_ freely, chaining outputs into inputs in a way that's generative. everything echoes; get the echoes in the right order and you get resonance; get the wrong resonance and you get pain.

putting it in the wrong order does kill the flow, but ordering itself is not killing. _but_ if the concept of ordering becomes load-bearing for you by way of making sense of killing, it might take a long time for you to notice that ordering is _grammar_ and not, itself, a sentence.

I suspect that "ordering" _is_ the function of "living" - placing this before that, or after, or between, or around, or to the side until later. "living" as the ongoing series of enacted spatial mutations from a living locus (recursive definition intentional). a "disorder", then, if I might retcon my own etymology as a thinking tool, might be essentially spatial: a "dysorder", really, resulting in the experience of "dysregulation". "rearrange and wait" might be a better prescription for disorder than "cease".
