theory: my clear obsession with "what if I'm alone" _is_ my energizer bunny

theory: everyone has a "what if" that does something like that for them, a "what if" that feels world-ending that never comes true but nonetheless spurs _so_ much generativity. it's like a power source that lives in a pocket universe. mistake it for _your own_ universe, and you end up a doomsday prepper maybe? respect it as an unreachable terminus, and the space between you becomes a resource
