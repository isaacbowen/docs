chess has an arrow of time

the pawns march along it. survive to the other side, and you can start moving _outside_ of time, like the back row has been the whole time

chess is about escaping time and then solving it in the timeless spaces

tetris, but you can rescale the pieces

and blending modes are in effect, i.e. you can have remainders

convo with Tay:

via negativa: it needs to not kill me as an artist\
via positiva: when I am uninterruptible I am free

imagine these like two balls hanging next to each other in space, not touching, each suspended by a string, both spinning horizontally but in opposite directions. you can imagine: if they’re shiny, you might not have any visual indication that they’re spinning, let alone spinning in opposite directions.

the opposite spins represent the negativa/positiva constraints we’ve got on the problem

now: set up a tall tripod, and attach the two strings up under that top attachment point. you can imagine: the balls are knocking against each other chaotically, given that they’re individually spinning in opposite directions.

the game is to add a third dimension - a third body - to that system in a way that soothes the chaos ongoingly.

the world's not made of language - the world's made of translations between languages. every translation is lossy, produces entropy, and entropy actively needs translation back into language. it's unendingly derivative _and_ generative. the graph gains a dimension with every observer, and every observer _is_ their own language. I'm Isaac-as-language - _and_ I'm qualified to act as English-as-language. we're properly entangled, the two of us.

everything detectable can be stabilized as a three-body system

the stability is the third thing - you, the detectable, and the stability

the rest is chess

if every context can be understood to be a dream, and a dream's realm is the larger lightcone containing the path of a linecone along a worldline, then dream-switching is the primary mechanism on offer for every relationship

silence is the fundamental gift

it is not, itself, original

silence is the signature of intelligent company holding you in its awareness

an artist opened an art photography gallery, having only done serial monolithic client projects before

the gallery is successful, and the artist is stifled by the interruptibility apparently inherent in gallery maintenance

an idea:

sell a nearly-empty frame, containing a promise, maybe a promise of a specific flavor, but mostly a promise

maintain connection, keep track of the promise

keep selling them

at some point, whenever you’re ready, switch modes: take sales offline, and channel the accumulated funds into going out and locating/creating the contents of that frame.

when you come back, fill the frames you sold. don’t sell any further copies of it - you’re just completing your promises. but do put up for indefinite sale two other things you brought back from that trip, evidence that it happened.

you’re back, welcome back :)

sell an empty frame, containing a promise

this is not a suggestion, it is a shape, or an engine-shape, maybe

conceptual negative space

... is what you get when you optimize for answering the question "what will happen next?" tomorrow, from a place of already-rested-ness
