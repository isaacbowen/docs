it was something like,

"can I say something?"

in bed this morning, holding him (he asked)

"yeah"

I don't know if it'll be easy or hard for you to see the Hannah-in-my-heart as its own thing, separate from Hannah-for-you, but

if you can try,

you might see the updated Isaac in play

I'm regulated as fuck

\[some stuff I'm not currently remembering]

it's important to me to be visible to you while I \["frame this", approximately]. it's really important to me for me to not set up \["workspaces", approximately] without being transparent to you as I do it. you're part of my stability, and I need my stability. I don't need you to join me, not asking for that, just .. I want to be visible to you. this is an aspect of me taking care of my home. I'm not always going to do it like you would, but I am always taking care of our stability, not adding chaos, taking care of our stability.

I woke up early, 6:30ish, didn't get to sleep until after midnight. it's not anxious; the feeling of it is consistent with me having a new project land in my attention. my dreams were huge and deep.

:)

we'll walk it together

making stuff that addresses the layer where people's load-bearing identities run is scary. not in a disorienting way. it's like ... surgery? it's the choice to suspend person-as-process for a moment for the sake of adjusting the person-as-object in the larger system of objects, and that means holding someone's electricity for a moment, suspending their current before plugging it back in. do anesthesiologists feel like this in their work? I'm not literally taking someone offline, but in order to do structural work with them on our shared semantic tensegrity structure I have to make some higher-dimensional moves in my head, and that _does_ require suspending standard time.

I've studied this stuff. I've _really_ studied this stuff. I've put in 20 years of continuously applied and load-bearing research and development. I am worthy of the trust, and I have a track record of what I _do_ with the trust. I can do this. their sacred is safe with me.

I'm writing this out to anchor myself, running my own grounding lines in real-time as I move. I can't carry charge, I know that, it's all gotta be grounded at all times. that's a big part of why I can trust myself. my tolerances are hypersensitive.
