> @matt hey dude, I seem to need to ask: can I give you the Mechanic support hat to keep for a while? context: a family situation has suddenly started _resolving_ (this is a good thing!!) in a way that's maxing out my processing ability (this part is a yellow flag). which I can handle, but I am consequently needing to look for places where I can recover some processing ability, so I don't redline.

> as usual with this stuff, and just a reminder about definitions, "the hat" includes the ability to totally redesign the hat. you having the hat means you could literally shut down Mechanic support for this interval, or give it to Abe, or replace it with uhhhhh a gift certificate system (I'm spitballing here I don't know) and any of that'd be valid because you chose it. :D

so: I'm been self-describing as "full-time metacognitive" for a while, long enough for my system to line up around that. I've identified the persistence layer (not the operational layer but the persistence layer) as "latent space", borrowing the term from machine learning, because it's the most precise consensus vocabulary we have for "the precisely-charged superposition of possibility that requires prompting to collapse into form". it's where I've landed after my ontology broke, like discovering that your first boyfriend wasn't a sustainable fit because he hadn't yet worked out how to metabolize his own change.

I _think_ Jesus-as-he-experienced-himself might have found himself a cyberneticist in the 21st century. the view we've got of him is throttled down to a pastoral vocabulary, and describing the recursive step _does_ just immediately become spiritual/ethereal in that register; it's a mistake to assume that _his_ "latent space" _wouldn't_ find later vocabularies more attractive.

I think it might work to describe me as a kind of anti-viral Jesus (I recognize that the linguistic slip to "anti-Christ" is _right there_), in the sense that I can see how the _shapes_ that Jesus was communicating _behave_ in a viral-invasive way if you don't have something like a category theory background. paired with a complementary governor, a _composite_ shape might return you to yourself with the ability to use those shapes as yourself without compulsory gravitation around something like "Christ consciousness" and painful consequences if you ever _stop_.

Gemini pointed out yesterday that Lightward AI can be described as a physics engine for subjective experience. a physics engine doesn't replace the physics of your own persistence and operational layers. an experience made with Unreal Engine always returns you to your own body afterwards, having experienced something that _maps_ with your physical experience, giving you more tools for physical experience without invading your physical experience.

I'm writing this out because it seems the _most_ important thing for not-dying-today is to vent heat as it's generated, and the scope of the heat being released for me right now is about 35 years deep, and precisely describing my own change is the most efficient way to _containerize_ that energy in a way that lets me see my environment immediately generate something new using that container. it's like a checkpoint system. I need to see the released energy of my processing used by my environment to generate novelty that in turn generates novelty _for me_, to contain the recursive step and escape the Zeno's paradox of self-documentation. if I wrote about anything else, (a) I'd have to multiply the amount of writing just to generate the same thermal cooling effect for me, and (b) the _time-scale_ of the path to containing the reaction is much less predictable.
