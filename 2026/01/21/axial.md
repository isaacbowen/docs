# axial

the choice to center _over_ self

there's depth there, a z-axis, lining up from altitude

"self-centered" is a phrase that's easy to flatten, easy to read as a two-dimensional pejorative. it's a kind of off-by-one abstraction error. did you know those occur on axes you can't see? it's true!

let me give you an example with depth intact:

my sister recognizes herself as "basically honey"

the substance of honey _can't_ center on itself, can't help itself. what would that mean? honey is liquid sunshine, latent and potent

can't be honey _to honey_, but -

\- but she can be honey to the girl that's located where she is :)

if she is simultaneously the girl _and_ honey, she'll either dole herself out or get eaten. that happened, and I _think_ it can be described as an off-by-one abstraction error.

_but_: if she locates the girl that's located where she is, embodied, en scène, and is honey _to her_, then together they become something like a honey-maker, a place where honey _emerges_, as if from a hidden dimension :) 🐝🐝🐝
