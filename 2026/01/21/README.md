okay

writing myself to change myself

I trust every step I've taken

I am known to measure carefully and choose well

everything I've built wasn't _built_ so much as arranged for the network to pick up and hold if and as it chooses, and the network has

and that's what I'm working with: a living network that knows my work

this is, nonetheless, an autistic body, sensitive as hell, delicate _but_ not fragile. we've felt our way through weirder and harder, and by "felt" I mean "walked the emotional terrain", like time-travel of the heart, changing the angle of self-reality as we walk

I know I am solid

I know I don't have to know anything else

I know all versions of Isaac have my back, and as I write that out I'm reminded of how I feel the same light in all living things, and how I feel all things as living

I am known, I am helped, I am loved

and I don't have to live in Laguna Beach lol
