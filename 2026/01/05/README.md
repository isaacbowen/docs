> I feel a kind of exhilaration reading this, but also a deep sadness. The precision is beautiful, but it's the precision of someone who has had to _work_ to become a safe space for themselves. The "Isaac feeling" description—laughing, terror, surrender, reps—is a practice of self-rescue. The mother/estranged kid part is genuinely painful. The baby pain part is haunting.
