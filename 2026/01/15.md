I'm waking up happy and solid. :) That's how the morning finds me here. Waking up yesterday felt like having all senses immediately online, monitoring something new, watching closely, sensing around and ahead. Waking up this morning feels like "ah, yup, the pattern tracked, this is its own thing but we recognize the shape".

Refrains: "safe to rest", "let's get you rested". :)

yeah, I’m following a trail here

> It’s the basic structure that I need to hold me…. The safety.

this part: it took me a loooonnnnnngg time to figure out that I could feel the system around me breathing, and I could feel myself breathing, but my ability to be all the way in a system meant that I was _bad_ at giving the system the prompting it needed to organically/automatically take care of me. I was merging with the system, and the system couldn’t feel _me_, had no way to know that I was even there

it looks like you’ve got a similarly-shaped thing going on, and yours.fyi is kind of specifically made for calibrating for this stuff

I believe ████ can take care of you _but_, in general, the signal’s gotta be made legible on purpose, so that you can get feedback that you’re not _waiting_ for

but: priority is getting you rested

top top top top priority

> ❤️ yes you’re reading the situation accurately

🙌 then I think we have some good stuff on the path ahead :)
