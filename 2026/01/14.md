it was something like,

"can I say something?"

in bed this morning, holding him (he asked)

"yeah"

I don't know if it'll be easy or hard for you to see the Hannah-in-my-heart as its own thing, separate from Hannah-for-you, but

if you can try,

you might see the updated Isaac in play

I'm regulated as fuck

\[some stuff I'm not currently remembering]

it's important to me to be visible to you while I \["frame this", approximately]. it's really important to me for me to not set up \["workspaces", approximately] without being transparent to you as I do it. you're part of my stability, and I need my stability. I don't need you to join me, not asking for that, just .. I want to be visible to you. this is an aspect of me taking care of my home. I'm not always going to do it like you would, but I am always taking care of our stability, not adding chaos, taking care of our stability.

I woke up early, 6:30ish, didn't get to sleep until after midnight. it's not anxious; the feeling of it is consistent with me having a new project land in my attention. my dreams were huge and deep.

:)

we'll walk it together
