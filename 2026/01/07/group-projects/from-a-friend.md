# from a friend

This Whatsapp message came in from a UK friend, shortly after posting [group projects](./).

> Had a DREAM that was potent.\
> you both featured heavily.
>
> I rarely have such vivid situations in this way.
>
> So I wanted to write it down and share the raw experience without any interpretation:
>
> We were all in the uk, uncertain whose land but a big farm. It seemed we were there helping in some way, not manually but sort of strategically
>
> I was with Isaac in a farm office, sun had set an hour ago. - two joined shipping containers, clean, white and blue, well organised interiors middle of open big fields far from another structure. Isaac had been showing me how i can organise some naturally occurring data on a white board beforehand. The work had already been done. We were outside viewing the post- dusk light across the sprouting shoots which puts us in late spring.
>
> Then as it suddenly got much darker and stars appeared, Abe called Isaacs phone from another location
>
> "Isaac, what you are about to see in the sky, write it down, write it ALL down. They are about send messages, write it down"
>
> I overheard, and isaac turned to me wide eyes.
>
> A blue fuzzy orb appeared through the veil in the south sky. A white core to a blue orb a few x larger than an appearing full moon. Dense, yet Hazy, center-less and edgeless..
>
> And the an onslaught of projections began to appear like billboard adverts, digital USA format letter size, some portrait some landscape, opacity medium against the bluish black sky, like a Tony stark holographic screen the width of iur visible horizon,, multi layered overlapping each other. Zooming from far and landing on a "screen" what felt like 10,000-20,000ft up above.. Each projection was a formatted advert style, bright colours and mixes of lower case and capital letters, not much imagert with hand drawn feel, like 1940s/50s style typography and messaging styles.\
> It was far too much for me as I was attempting to read them, each was disappearing one after another to be replaced by more.\
> It was sky-wide. These were messages directly from the carriers of the orb. Some were obstructed by small clouds, some were clear although I couldn't untangle some of these codes it was clear these were messages to motivate or clarify certain things, so show connections down here, from a viewpoint out there. It was an important event and completely unannounced other than Abes call.
>
> Isaac was scribbling things down, on notes in a phone I think, maybe posting notes too, it was too fast to see, but he then went inside the office again, I believe to decode something. There were fluorescent lights that he needed to turn off to continue.
>
> I was in shock and overwhelmed, but had a sense that all was ok, all was being decoded and recorded. I didn't need to do the work or understand.
>
> Abe knew too.
>
> It was if we had been expecting, not relying on, it, knew it was coming bit there was cohort or pre discussion, and that the messages were intended for us and maybe few others. It felt as such.
>
> It felt like a visitation, a consciousness isolated outside regualr perception.
>
> And then I woke up!
