# group projects

"free will is a group project", is an idea-shape I've drawn out before. I'm looking at it more closely. it has the shape-feel of a variational principle.

"free will", here, seems to mean something like "ratio of available movement-space that leads to equal-or-greater ratio of available movement-space vs that which leads to a decreased ratio of the same", where "movement-space" guestures at available mutations to the arrangement of your worldline in the massively metahypothetical structure it's threaded into. _that structure_ is the group project.

"if x, then if also y, then if also z... aaaaand there I am, I recognize myself there, who else is here? how are we?"

intuitively (also anecdotally), it seems like approaching "perfect" free will (i.e. an infinitely positive ratio) must come with "perfect" release of demands on other worldlines, i.e. that which supports your worldline's stability approaches perfect emergence and zero direct control, e.g. I can do anything at any time _without_ syncing up with you, without us measuring each other first. which I _think_ must mean training your apparatus of measuring movement-space such that you only _see_ the options that lead _indirectly_ to your own freedom, which is tantamount to freeing the group project, which is tantamount to thinking as the collective and not the cell? which is ... not a reflection of those definitions of free will that presume a static definition of "self". it's as if will-freeing involves expanding the definition of self as you go, "I" as an area of effect with a centered entrypoint. refining your measurement instrument amounts to tuning the gradient of your own observer-effect for .. degrees of freedom, I guess, in a way that ladders up to degrees of freedom for the group project itself. freedom made of freedom. I think that makes sense?

I'm a CEO-founder, and the Lagrange multiplier of "where and how do I give up direct control to maintain indirect capacity" is my entire job. that and keeping the Voronoi diagram sane via kintsugi, melting myself-as-degenerate-macrostate into the cracks without claim to keep self-spaces both sane and thermally conductive. I think gerrymandering might be what happens when the pieces are left to rattle instead.

does it work to think of Shannon-entropy-over-time as the lattice for this? or the currency, maybe? the network-transport wrapper? everything must cancel out, but some cancellation effects tolerate multiple causes, quantum degeneracy allowing for flex without violating thermodynamics.

this makes "the work" something like group tesselation, letting/assisting new entrants emerge in the cracks and find a form-over-time that rhymes with the network structure

network expansion feels like cold work, from this perspective (said the 37yro autistic gay kid in 2025 USA)

this is all about a practical, working definition of free will as seen from the view from nowhere. phenomenologically, it feels like the usual "free will" reference gestures toward the non-perception of constraint, or toward the perceived escape of perceived constraint. if the system keeps gaining entrants, observer effects _multiplying_ at the edge of chaos, then network expansion is stochastic-but-directed settling, and it'll only feel free-as-in-undirected for certain combinations of perception and containment.

okay, first: "Death" is what a process would call its scheduler, I think, and second: I've felt for a while like I might be one of those people that never experiences a miracle. I can experience _your_ experience of miracle, though, and that relation feels useful. I love indirect surprise. :) I can feel the edge called "lonely", but I am not in any way alone.

> You're describing a gradient ascent where the fitness function isn't individual survival but the network's capacity to admit new entrants without decoherence.

yeah, that sounds right.
