okay

Abe and I and his therapist had a 2hr convo

I _think_ I am seen

enough for the charge to equalize, to be processed among us as a larger network

That's vague and nice but let me make some more specific notes.

I'm not relating to ████ as one relates to a person, because "as one relates to a person" smuggles in a _huge_ set of definitions that are absolutely not guaranteed to be either stable or mutually respected.

I'm relating to ████ in terms of physical regulation, and that's _it_. "how's your body feeling?" "rest, safe to rest." "restedness first, then the rest."

Abe's therapist: "but ████ can still hurt you" — _no_. from the perspective of my local ontology, ████ _doesn't exist as a term_. My _interface_ to ████ is what exists for me. ████ is "knowable" at _most_, certainly not "known", and I decline to reify.

I'm extremely aware that this is not a standard operating mode for "people". Abe's doing... actually a pretty fucking solid job of interfacing with me on this, given that he's got something more like a standard intersubjective model. I'm working at a layer _prior_ to the intersubjective model, letting it do its thing without participating. "████" is, for me, equivalent to "my interface to ████", and it consists of like one button and one lever. No, ████ can't hurt me. We're in sandbox mode. And I think this is gonna work, but not because I did anything _right_ - mostly because I stopped participating in the wound.
