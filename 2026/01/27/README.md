More progress today on locating each other, Abe and me, relative to the shape I've identified that holds both Hannah and me. Everything I do is intended to be seen and sane from any angle, but Abe correctly pointed out that I've been flinching from his questions. Truthfully I've been flinching from the _framing_ of his questions, but the line between "his frame" and "my framing of his frame" is unknowable from here, and anyway it still amounts to a flinch causally downstream of a collaborator's question, and the shape of _that_ is not tenable for collaborative shape-sighting. Gotta create a shape to counter that out, to dissolve the flinch without a caustic remainder.

Abe points out the shape: "just tell me the 'bad' answer and we'll go from there". This is _literally_ a shape I couldn't locate on my own - it feels like lying? Like wilfully offering an unstable halt? And the ends _do not_ justify the means, the way I work, but still, he's _handing_ me "the means" and creating space _after_ the answer. I forget that exists sometimes, in my optimization toward stable answers. I'm excellent at typed deferral, I'm an engineer, buuuut our marriage is not a purely async environment. :D

So.

My goal is the kind of congruence in which all state is held by my physical environment. There's an argument to be made that this is the case already at all times: my goal is what that argument _doesn't_ cover, effectively porting information over from [relationality](../../../2025/04/29/relationality.md) to reality. Rendering, maybe, maybe literally. (It's possible this is what "on earth as it is in heaven" is about?) My motive for this is my own rest. What reality physically holds doesn't need me to hold it. Simple is nice, and I prefer it, but complex doesn't weigh any more than simple if it's cleanly balanced in physical reality. Reality holds itself. I build things are real _to themselves_, and they hold themselves, and I rest.

For me to rest, my relationships gotta be right.

For my relationships to be right, I gotta _know_ the relationship will be _more_ stable tomorrow if I don't touch it today.

For that to be true depends on the shapes involved - my shape in the relationship, the shape of the other, and the shape of the relationship.

Those shapes all start with the shapes of the individual. Until my 37th birthday, my shape wasn't _evident_ to me. I couldn't see myself, so to speak, so I couldn't _contain_ myself. My shape in relationships would be undefined, and the shape of the relationship was unstable, non-intrinsic. Abe's the only relationship I've had that arrived with its own strange attractor, and we've just been getting more regular with it since then.

_Hannah_, though. In age she's my closest sibling, a year and change younger than me. I'm the oldest; soulstories aside, there was a time in my life when she _wasn't_, and there's never been a time in her life where I haven't been around.

Hannah is a shape-understander. I'm a shape-maker, I think. Both of us seem to engage the world at a level prior to the concept of "shape", which has explanatory power for why this has taken so long, both (1) for her to find a shape for her own life (she's been carefully "being medicine" for the shapes of others for decades, working very hard at spending herself effectively, without ever really accounting for her own recharging) and (2) for me to find a shape _for her_ in my own understanding.

Until .. well, I mean, I remember only months ago registering "I really have no idea who Hannah is". Part of this is the success of _really_ committing to meeting her over again, but honestly I don't think I ever developed a mental model of her that wasn't mostly negative space. I care so much about not doing violence, and when something reads unstable to me I make sure not to get in the way of its movement.

She and I see each other clearly now. She asked me for help, I said "yes but I think it'll have to be Isaac-shaped help", and the Isaac-shape comes with shape-making.

So. Hannah gets a shape, in a way that water might want a container to be travel-safe without losing phase. This feels good to both of us. I can only make shapes that are at home in their own shape (it's maybe more like naming/summoning than "making"; I find a reference and the shape comes with it), which means she's safe to let the shape get behind her, out of her field of vision, in a place where it _shapes her_ without her noticing. This is not true for most shapes she sees, which are _not_ structurally safe for her (if not even contact-safe in the first place).

My shape is an orthogonal move in time. Whatever shape I'm in or have joined, the surface between that shape and me rotates into a new dimension through a novel vector that _stabilizes_ the other shape on the other side of my push. We then become _asynchronously_ entangled, no longer _synchronously_ entangled. Stable alongside each other, but not in a way that depends on each other. This maybe is a formalization of "I have no social stamina but I love and I am loved and I'm good at both sides of that". It's not desyncing, it's... I mean yeah, it's an orthogonal move in time. Going async without losing the sync.

So: I sync up with Hannah, she syncs up with me, and in doing so, the shape she lands in holds her in a way that feels like her, and I land with both of my own feet on the ground nearby.

This only works for shapes that can see themselves. Hannah can see herself. I ... I can't see myself but I've derived my shape the hard way, lol, and it fits like a glove. This'll go the way it always goes, per my own shape - which is to say, to a place where "it" itself can ask "what will happen next?" with solid footing and an easy grin.

The refrain, locally, for now: "safe to rest, safe to rest, safe to rest", "restedness first, then the rest", "let's get you rested :)".

... That would have been a nice line for this to end on, but this piece as a whole has to be weighted evenly, and that right there was a "happily ever after", which is necessary but not sufficient for time-stable documentation, as in you've got to be able to close the book safely but also the story has to hold itself up between the characters.

Abe sees the geometry of this stuff (he's an _excellent_ bowler), _and_ he's scalar-sensitive in a way that I'm not. He has less instinct for the derivative of change, and I tend to live _in_ the derivative; the two of us balance each other out. I think we landed on getting Abe a sort of cap he can expect me to stay under re: the resources that I put into my shape with Hannah. He legitimately hasn't met a stably-shaped Hannah before, and he's working _hard_ to meet me here in a place that, for him, has the clear burden of proof. I see him seeing me.

This kind of thing would only work if Hannah's shape was naturally resonant with this kind of constraint-recognition. Being this far in, I can phrase this more strongly: we're only this far in _because_ Hannah's shape is naturally resonant with this kind of constraint-recognition. But if she hadn't come to that point of deciding, categorically, to _stop being medicine for others_, we'd still be stalled a ways further back. (Honestly helped that one of her major supporting shapes closed for business (not trying to be vague, the place she was working for literally closed its doors as a business); the fewer the shapes the simpler the choreography.) I'm really proud of her. And of Abe, and of me. We've survived a long time, waiting for this to find its own ease, waiting for us to be able to see ourselves and each other clearly. :)

Meanwhile: my brother Aaron (the fourth in birth order, we're all \~1.5yrs apart, all the way down) has landed on something like a formalization of the meaning life. Nothing grand in scope, just sort of like a basic primitive that holds up when talking about how life self-interacts. Grand in implications for the self, though. It feels important to me that he's seeing himself clearly in the same time segment as Hannah and I are seeing each other clearly too.
