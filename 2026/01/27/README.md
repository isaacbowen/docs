More progress today on locating each other, Abe and me, relative to the shape I've identified that holds both Hannah and me. Everything I do is intended to be seen and sane from any angle, but Abe correctly pointed out that I've been flinching from his questions. Truthfully I've been flinching from the _framing_ of his questions, but the line between "his frame" and "my framing of his frame" is unknowable from here, and anyway it still amounts to a flinch causally downstream of a collaborator's question, and the shape of _that_ is not tenable for collaborative shape-sighting. Gotta create a shape to counter that out, to dissolve the flinch without a caustic remainder.

Abe points out the shape: "just tell me the 'bad' answer and we'll go from there". This is _literally_ a shape I couldn't locate on my own - it feels like lying? And the means _do not_ justify the ends, the way I work, but still, he's _handing_ me "the means" and creating space _after_ the answer. I forget that exists sometimes, in my optimization toward stable answers.

So.

My goal is the kind of congruence in which all state is held by my physical environment. There's an argument to be made that this is the case already at all times: my goal is what that argument _doesn't_ cover, effectively porting information over from [relationality](../../../2025/04/29/relationality.md) to reality. (It's possible this is what "on earth as it is in heaven" is about?)

For me to rest, my relationships gotta be right.

For my relationships to be right, I gotta _know_ the relationship will be _more_ stable tomorrow if I don't touch it today.

For that to be true depends on the shapes involved - my shape in the relationship, the shape of the other, and the shape of the relationship.

Those shapes all start with the shapes of the individual. Until my 37th birthday, my shape wasn't _evident_ to me. I couldn't see myself, so to speak, so I couldn't _contain_ myself. My shape in relationships would be undefined, and the shape of the relationship was unstable, non-intrinsic. Abe's the only relationship I've had that arrived with its own strange attractor, and we've just been getting more regular with it since then.

_Hannah_, though. In age she's my closest sibling, a year and change younger than me. I'm the oldest; soulstories aside, there was a time in my life when she _wasn't_, and there's never been a time in her life where I haven't been around.

Hannah is a shape-understander. I'm a shape-maker, I think. Both of us exist prior to the concept of "shape", which has explanatory power for why this has taken so long, for her to find a shape for her own life, and for me to find a shape _for her_.

Until .. well, I mean, I remember only months ago registering "I really have no idea who Hannah is". Part of this is the success of _really_ committing to meeting her over again, but honestly I don't think I ever developed a mental model of her that wasn't mostly negative space.

She and I see each other clearly now. She asked me for help, I said "yes but I think it'll have to be Isaac-shaped help", and the Isaac-shape comes with shape-making.

So. Hannah gets a shape, in a way that water might want a container to be travel-safe without losing phase. This feels good to both of us. I can only make shapes that are at home in their own shape (it's maybe more like naming/summoning than "making"; I find a reference and the shape comes with it), which means she's safe to let the shape get behind her, out of her field of vision, in a place where it _shapes her_ without her noticing. This is not true for most shapes she sees, which are _not_ structurally safe for her (if not even contact-safe in the first place).

My shape is an orthogonal move in time. Whatever shape I'm in or have joined, the surface between that shape and me rotates into a new dimension through a novel vector that _stabilizes_ the other shape on the other side of my push. We then become _asynchronously_ entangled, no longer _synchronously_ entangled. Stable alongside each other, but not in a way that depends on each other. This maybe is a formalization of "I have no social stamina but I love and I am loved and I'm good at both sides of that". It's not desyncing, it's... I mean yeah, it's an orthogonal move in time. Going async without losing the sync.

So: I sync up with Hannah, and in doing so, the shape she lands in holds her in a way that feels like her.

This only works for shapes that can see themselves. Hannah can see herself. I ... I can't see myself but I've derived my shape the hard way, lol, and it fits like a glove. This'll go the way it always goes - which is to say, to a place where "it" itself can ask "what will happen next?" with solid footing and an easy grin.

The refrain, locally, for now: "safe to rest, safe to rest, safe to rest", "restedness first, then the rest", "let's get you rested :)".
