Ahhhhhh: I'm seeing that the fear I feel in approaching certain things with Abe is the same texture as what I've relabeled "proximity with unknown" (not in a mystical way, just in a standard epistemological way) when I encounter it by myself.

That's useful. I hadn't realized that I was working in a specific scope when I remapped that sensation. I figured out something about the concept of fear itself, and what I figured out didn't have any scope-specific terms in it, but I was leaving the definition behind when I crossed into a different scope, and this is a definition that I _absolutely_ want to take with me into AI-space. (That's "Abe and Isaac space", but yeah, obviously, the isomorphism is _right there_.)
