# marbled

imagine a marble rolling down a surface

imagine a marble of uneven density rolling down a surface - like a pro bowling ball with a complex inner weight block

imagine a marble of uneven density rolling down a surface, then rolling _up_ an adjoining surface, its momentum arrested, redirected, the marble being compelled back onto the surface it was just rolling down

imagine a marble of uneven density rolling down a surface, then rolling up a Stewart platform

imagine the Stewart platform testing the marble, mapping its interior based on how it reacts to gravity plus its own momentum plus the particular motion enacted by the platform

imagine a marble of uneven density with a wildly complex spin finding its way onto such a Stewart platform, and the platform cancelling out all aspects of the spin at the moment of the marble's departure _from_ that platform, giving the marble an auto-inference opportunity in a space that's denoising _itself_ based on _you_

I think that's what we do here

you contain what's next, and we just improve the efficacy of your self-calibration so you can follow your own roll properly

important: this approach is _not_ dependency-creating. we neutralize that spin, too. far as your vestibulary is concerned, we were never here, but there _is_ less physical noise in the system now.

I've been rolling with the theory that every inhabitable domain can be modeled as a Hilbert space having as many dimensions as are required to describe the observer's position in that domain. three-dimensional spaces are _everywhere_.

the Stewart platform I described is itself a mathematical object, I _think_ it's something like an abstract Y combinator generator: a function which returns a fixed-point combinator for the space in which the observer invoking the generator is defined.

it seems like churches and startup accelerators are both filled with instances of this object: platforms that help a recursive observer locate itself, assistive companioning in the journey to the self. a self that lasts in place is entropically dissipative; a self that last as itself is a strange attractor. these things are hard to measure, because measuring such a thing only tells you about yourself.

I have a candle whose vessel reads "'Nothing gives rest but the sincere search for truth.' Blaise Pascal", and I _think_ what I'm looking at is a mathematical formalization of this. "nothing handles entropy but measuring such that you don't contaminate the measured", if I compress it.

from the outside, it'll look like the marble was accelerated into something cleaner and faster. careful: _you can't optimize for cleaner and faster directly._ the platform is empty, it's _just_ noise-removal, it can't be measured without implicating yourself as a term in the system. you contain what's next, we optimize for that, and whatever it looks like is beside the point. it's fun work. :)

btw: I write this as a marble who had to figure out that its core was platform-shaped. this was fucking difficult. I hope to make it easier for whoever's next. I suspect everyone's inheriting from platform-shape-ness, but I also suspect that most people have that shape a few tiers further down. I'm autistic; my gloss is very thin.

removing this piece itself as a front-row term from the motion of your thought, what does the experience of reading this do for your awareness of your own movement? it only works if you're willing, because your will is your motion, and your motion is what this measures. and you're (here), so, \o/
