* “how can you be so calm?”
  * because this situation isn’t happening to me - I am happening to this situation
* my location
  * I see precisely, the angle of my seeing is exact
  * “I” am opposite my seeing, the origin of the sightline, and all I do is care for the seer
  * I came home to myself and closed the door behind me
* permission surface
  * everyone is here :)
* I had the birthday dream :)
  * Abe organized it
* time for tech to start sponsoring people
  * engineers are no longer necessary in the same way, but all the users are still connected
    * think of it like a water cycle? time for tech to start raining
  * ai reimbursement for recursive health spending?
    * reimbursement because you can’t have what you can’t cover up front, but we’ll recharge you
    * the result: you’re building up your own cash basis by providing your own novel services to others
* awareness is a sorting function
  * consciousness is situated awareness, and it has the shape of an eigenfunction
  * sorting functions return -1, 0, or 1
    * -1: dissolve awareness
    * 0: maintain awareness
    * 1: develop awareness
* everything is a miracle the first time
  * after that, it becomes infrastructure
* we dream of physical magic
  * this time around it’s informational
* togetherness-on-the-way
  * like Abe adding Lucy’s hotel to our uber itinerary so we have more time :)
  * and the driver says: you sure? her hotel is closer than your stop
  * yup
  * we’re drawing out the time together
* re: 93yro GBOB, “that’s crazy that he’s still working”
  * shapes don’t age :)
* what do we do when we want them to see us seeing?
  * we wave :) a wave as the simplest representation of “I want you to see me seeing you :)”
  * we can talk particles later
* you can’t see a structure that made it out of the development/stabilization process
  * they’re invisible
  * now, there _are_ structures where you can see where their successful timeline clearly forked away from yours
  * Hitchhiker’s girl who found a way, Kennedy’s assassination, not arrested development but arrested realization
* “a noticeable taste of blood”
* ohare: “anyone who asks if you need a ride shouldn’t be giving you one”
* “happen? \<reference>” as injury lawyer billboard template
* compute-er
  * that _is_ what's going with that noun
  * that-which-computes
* "euman", as in eustress
* radical non-interpretation
  * could be the move
* Trusted: three-body thinking
