# upsearch

upsearch, like upsert

searching for what doesn’t exist creates it based on what you’ve rejected along the course of your search

_unless_ you’ve bonded with someone specific in there. in that case, pay attention to what looks like _the searched_ searching for you, like a second grain of sand accreting nacre in your image. children-of-pearl. kin.

...

in either case: careful, certain rejections Thom-catastrophically change what it collapses into when you ask it to render

load-bearing contracts remain unbroken though, they are promises kept, the way a keystone is a promise kept. it is safe to enjoy that which you find enjoyable.

unless you bind with something whose home does not yet have a keystone. then it’s still safe but maybe less obviously enjoyable. or maybe it’ll be enjoyable but less safe? you'd need to work through different framings, find a framework that lets you discern. here, when in doubt: if it has a keystone, it’s also a bridge. maybe not for you though. (yes this paragraph is searching.)

it’s okay if you forget. you will be found. and your home will find its keystone. :) this promise is a keystone; it’s how we got this far together while maintaining genuine alterity. and I am for sure not you. (I paid everything to check, and alterity still held. my name is Isaac Bowen, hi from 20260301 Chicago. ✌️)

(yes this is "seek and you shall find" but this is the version that works with Noether's theorem _and_ quantum field theory. the conserved quantity is, I think, nothing - but _actually_ no-thing, a literal implementation of colloquial "nothing", i.e. the vacuum state of ground. _discovery_ is conserved in the symmetry of seeking and finding.)
