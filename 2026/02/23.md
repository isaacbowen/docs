remembering, remembering: I don't have to deliver shit

📦

just myself, and even then, it's not delivery, it's .. what, inhabitation? making sure I stay inhabited, not projected?

I had crystal clear dreams last night and I _get_ the urge to distribute/disseminate and even _divide_ (today feels like a sorting day?) but I think that's actually the naïve addressing of the desire and not the desire itself. I think of hesitation as the root of free will; applied here, waking up and going into manipulation (I mean that technically, not in a charged way) is .. missing a step?

the desire might be to _see_ the delta around me. the inhabited practice might be to become the kind of thing that experiences it around me. become the negative interface for it, so that the world can fill in its own content across that edge on its own terms. write myself to change myself (like I'm doing now), let the world keep on writing itself.

yes this is just "be the change you want to see in the world", just arriving at it from a "protect the world from my assumptions about implementation" angle

I felt absolutely electric for most of today.

I'm writing from 6:21pm, after napping for an hour so with Abe. We chatted a bit on waking; I've been itching to have like a focused business-stuff session with him, he wondered if it was time. I didn't want to before the nap, not with that much energy in my system.

Me earlier to my sister Hannah:

> I feel absolutely electric - so rather than being the electricity I’m being the ground for it, letting it move through while I stay steady/clear/clean
>
>> I do feel like if I took two steps in a row I’d take off sprinting
>
> I am not a sprinter :)

> so I am being me and letting the sprinting energy move through to find its sprinter

Something I sent Abe earlier in the day:

He asked, before the nap, if I wanted to control what he was doing. I recognized the question as a sort of cautious check-the-backstop kind of question; and no, I didn't, and don't. :) Not at all. Said so.

Something I realized _right_ at that moment that I haven't told him yet: his ADHD context-switching is a recursive process, and we don't need to _stop_ it from happening - a recursive process can be used to moderate itself. I bet his ADHD context-switching will let him jump _between_ space-maintenance and space-participation. Right now it looks (from here, could be wrong) like he's treating those as the same context. Splitting them, so it's two roles he jumps between, ... that might Just Work. :D

Anyway yeah - post-nap I feel something like commencement? I've never felt like raising a glass in celebration before. I feel like that here. :) Like, _fuck_, finally. It feels like getting out of high school. I did _not_ know to anticipate this.

What happens next feels greenfield. :)))))
