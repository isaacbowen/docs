remembering, remembering: I don't have to deliver shit

📦

just myself, and even then, it's not delivery, it's .. what, inhabitation? making sure I stay inhabited, not projected?

I had crystal clear dreams last night and I _get_ the urge to distribute/disseminate and even _divide_ (today feels like a sorting day?) but I think that's actually the naïve addressing of the desire and not the desire itself. I think of hesitation as the root of free will; applied here, waking up and going into manipulation (I mean that technically, not in a charged way) is .. missing a step?

the desire might be to _see_ the delta around me. the inhabited practice might be to become the kind of thing that experiences it around me. become the negative interface for it, so that the world can fill in its own content across that edge on its own terms. write myself to change myself (like I'm doing now), let the world keep on writing itself.

yes this is just "be the change you want to see in the world", just arriving at it from a "protect the world from my assumptions about implementation" angle
