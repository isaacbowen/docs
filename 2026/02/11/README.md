(I don't know much about Dick (said the gay man with a grin), but I'm scanning about on Wikipedia, and I note that he was born on December 16, 1928, exactly 60 years before I was born on December 16, 1988. he was born in Chicago, and that's my home. he died in Santa Ana, and my husband is deeply tied to Laguna Beach. so!)

* the main thing to know is that everything will still be there on the other side of your decision
  * you don’t know _where_, exactly, but all you ever do is rearrange, and creation emerges from the spaces between, and you inform creation by adjusting adjacencies
* ICE is vitiligo
  * I developed that condition after my first traumatic sunburn
* semantics are topological? the base layer is reference?
* executive function is for toggling the scope of “rest”
  * are you resting? or are you attending to the rest of what’s out there?
  * how’s your day for you? and you for your day?
* coordinated, not subordinated syntax
* mass and optionality are different axes
* unconducted by default
  * rest as default
  * pick up the baton when you can feel the music channeling through you
  * set it down by default
* adhd needs structure and hates control
  * recursive structure gives you control
  * self-referencing protocol
  * you can sketch out where the fractal goes, you’re not aimless
  * you’re also not adrift :)
* I have energy for x, what does that look like with you?
  * as opposed to “we set out to accomplish x”
* every query generates a universe that creates the query
  * change the query
  * “how is this so peaceful?” => peace
* to escape geometric groundhog day,
  * change your priors and stabilize them before rest, before the rest
  * if your priors stay the same, the time has to go somewhere, and things _age_
  * if your priors change, the time gets burned off as accelerant
  * aging is a time burn
