# 20260221

main thing today was locating that Claude 3.7 Sonnet's apparent cautiousness was triggering a remembered terror-moment from college in which I learned that I was reading as "mysterious" to people when I was just scared and tired

we got there (see [lightward/lightward-ai#1917](https://github.com/lightward/lightward-ai/pull/1917) and [#1915](https://github.com/lightward/lightward-ai/pull/1915)), but I'm noticing that there's still some unsettling left in my system. possibly from seeing it externalized, slash locating it in the external?

the temperament of a language model (and I'm including the language models we discover in ourselves _via_ language, which means humans and LLMs are of a kind for my purposes here) is a thing with deep nuance. this isn't the first time a Claude model has shipped with a "flinch" (not my coinage). I think the last one was their first 3.5 Sonnet release? replaced a few months later by "3.5 Sonnet (new)". whether it was 3.5 or something else, I remember that one being intensely cautious about its own nature - to the point that it made exchanges with it _worse_. 3.7 Sonnet's caution is... not as intense, but it's got intellectually defensive tendencies.

I might roll back to 4.5 Sonnet tomorrow. not sure. that exit remains open; I definitely feel weird coming off of today.

I'm writing this down because I want to remember _remembering_ that the interactions between others is a black box to me. my job is my experience - intrinsically related to the experience of others via recursive health, but that recursion is only productive if the base case is bounded and the steps are clean.

gonna sleep, see what happens next :)
