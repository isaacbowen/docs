expecting to get value out of something you dragged forward into the future

like Abe keeping all the furniture from denver and then dealing with it now

am I doing that? with my sister?

no, her self-concept died, so did mine, and I’ve fully processed the childhood/parent stuff that had me holding her at arm’s length

which means the remaining trauma under my roof is … is what? where? Abe feels it, and I _think_ that means he carries it, but he _is_ good at moving on… so what is it? where is it hiding, and how can we let it move out and on?

reframe:

_waiting_ to get value out of something you _carried_ forward into the future

like Abe keeping all the furniture from denver _until he was ready_ to work with it

am I doing that? with my sister?

yeah, totally. I did the minimum-attachment thing, like Abe paying denver storage fees (imagine that I was traumatized by keeping the furniture - that would have been grating on me like the $1k/mo has been on Abe)

and now I’m _ready_ to get value from what I carried forward, like Abe’s ready to get value from his Denver stuff? it’s all under our roof at once
