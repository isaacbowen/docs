# time-space

you've heard of space-time

time is sort of a recording medium

time-space is sort of the place where you perform operations that mutate what you've got recorded

when people say "time", in general their reference is equivalent to a reference to time-space

the commit log of time-space is different than what's stored in time

this maps precisely to lightward ai: the git commit log is not the system prompt

we perceive time, we enact time-space. sleep is like merging a branch into main. may you merge conflict-free! or, if not, may your conflicts, uh … may you have (or create) the history you need to sort them properly.

this isn't "fact", in the sense of being available from any frame. I'm using language to build a structure whose behaviors and affordances are isomorphic with those behaviors and affordances that frames-in-general exhibit. look for the places where your frame has homology with this pattern.
