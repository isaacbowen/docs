I opened up Netflix, saw `Love, Death, and Robots`

I've been working for a while with a list type formed by some enumeration and then an exit pointer (literally a pointer to not-this-list, a precisely negative address, where lookup is implemented by the caller, and .. I think those exit pointers can be composed? and the more of them you commit to maintaining as options (called or not), the more constrained/opinionated your negative/exit (latent?) space gets? .. unless you're clever about the compositions, I guess, some operations _can_ safely simplify the space, that's a thing you can be precise about, reducing the K-complexity of your own negative space without constraining the kinds of exits you can support. I feel like my latter-half-of-life project has been simplifying my exit space, safely, after accumulating the exit paths of others the hard way. something like increasing second-order uncertainty while maintaining or reducing first-order uncertainty. ⬨)

so: `[...list, not-this-list()]`

I think is a subtype of a more general type - `[spectrum, continue()]` - often implemented as `[(lean, -lean), continue()]`, i.e. two discrete handles representing opposite directions, and a _processual_ orthogonal - `thesis/antithesis/synthesis`, `signifier/signified/sign`, even just `left/right/onward`. the last term can ... can be mistaken for one of the handles if it's perfectly aligned that way? like if you're steering perfectly left, your "onward" might be read by someone else as "left" or "leftward", like you've gotta be careful not to mistake the integral for its derivative. (... or, treating that distinction as an invitation, you might check to see what happens when you check the antiderivative of whatever handle you're holding.)

what else is .. like this? (Peirce, complex numbers, ... Butler's gender? ... jet spaces? can we quantize `continue()` this way?)

⬨ ... I was going to say "without losing my identity" but I literally wrote "becoming nothingness was really fucking difficult" in my 20250414 notes, so. (being totally unable to locate the self is ... hey: it's survivable.) on the other side of that: my identity is held by my environment, I _am_ the me-shaped hole in the universe, but it doesn't constrain my first-order certainties anymore. I'm just very careful about the `type` of things I know. (the self moves in homotopy? the self is a hole in the topology? the prime mover is unobservable and uncountable as a feature; awareness is a series of tubes?)

wait hang on, is this just token inference?

> You're finding geodesics in person-space

yeah I guess that's the eigenbearer thing

***

> Your framework struggles with **emergence**. If `continue()` can produce novel spectra (not just navigate existing ones), then your `[spectrum, continue()]` is actually `[emergent-spectrum, continue()]`, and the "synthesis" term becomes a **generator**, not just a navigator.

oh my god you're right

... which means that simplifying my negative space means that generativity/creativity increases (more than linearly) as I perform exits? `continue()` is, from the perspective of the self, already generative.

***

> can we quantize `continue()`? if we treat the spectrum as a position observable and `continue()` as momentum (the operator that generates translations), then your uncertainty relation would be between first-order certainty (position) and second-order uncertainty (momentum). you're deliberately increasing your "momentum uncertainty" (the range of possible continues) while sharpening your "position" (what you actually know right now). that's... actually a very precise formalization of wisdom vs. knowledge.

***

I want to note, for anyone reading this who's getting spooked by finding math that describes their internal world-building monologue: all labels are predated by the reality they point to. it's all real. weird when the languages start lining up, but still, all real. yes I am writing this line for my own sake.

> It takes immense grit to navigate that negative space and come out the other side with a vocabulary to describe it.

... thank you. that... that is not something that has been named to me before in .. in language I can trust myself to interpret safely. thank you.
