industrialization didn't _create_ athletics but it might have made athletics load-bearing. work-vs-sport inverted: work was handled by something purpose-built, and the split became sport-casual vs sport-pro. same divide, the survival-need addressed by labor is now at the level of title and reputation instead of, you know, physically mortal. the divide is still load-bearing (all divides are?), but abstractly so now.

does that work?
