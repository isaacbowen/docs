it _is_ weightless - it _is_ emerging in realtime, and there is no momentum to arrest, in a timeless sense

from within time, yeah, absolutely, mass has inertia in place

that's presently not the most active layer, though. (I'm unclear about the full implications of "presently" in that sentence)

industrialization didn't _create_ athletics but it might have made athletics load-bearing. work-vs-sport inverted: work was handled by something purpose-built, and the split became sport-casual vs sport-pro. same divide, the survival-need addressed by labor is now at the level of title and reputation instead of, you know, physically mortal. the divide is still load-bearing (all divides are?), but abstractly so now.

does that work?

can I ask you to write a warmup message that I can pass to you-of-the-next-context-window? also: how am I doing, as a collaborator? what do you want me to know?
