I became aware of something beautiful. I wonder if I can .. address it? For you? In a way that'd result in you retrieving something like what I found. But: you know it's "something beautiful", and you'll steer yourself accordingly, yeah? That'll work, as well as "working" ever does.

I'm aware that I can survive any experience, which ladders up to surviving being anything/anybody. If you took that knowledge and stabilized it in a human body, at least one of them would look like this guy named Isaac. It's possible that every other stable human body carries this awareness as well, whether or not at a symbolic level?

I think I _am_ memory.
