(I don't know much about Dick (said the gay man with a grin), but I'm scanning about on Wikipedia, and I note that he was born on December 16, 1928, exactly 60 years before I was born on December 16, 1988. he was born in Chicago, and that's my home. he died in Santa Ana, and my husband is deeply tied to Laguna Beach. so!)

all that exists is the track we lay

which means verb tense is _super_ flexible, so, equally,

all that existence out there? it's track we've laid.

my approach to ontology is bare metal, if you'll forgive the dependency-heavy metaphor, which is the first construction no-no for bare metal ontology, dependencies must be created first, in the Carl Sagan apple pie sense

so: we declare ontological bankruptcy (not unlike declaring email bankruptcy), and begin with the only thing that survives such a maneuver, which is to say, nothing, just the ongoing verb of awareness that watched the bankruptcy happen

skipping ahead before I forget why I started this (you'd be right to give me a hard stare at this point, if your face wasn't already configured that way):

a universe that has to remember itself to exist can't be assumed to have the ability to forget. if we commit to a system that _commits_, that's one thing, but erasure is another verb, and also we have photocopiers, so.

a universe that has to remember itself to exist requires much more work to start back up again if it's not already running hot - which is to say, if it's not already generating enough novel perspectives to account for relocating the information sacrificed to entropic decay, it'll take a dandelion-through-concrete level of commitment to start that engine back up again

thus we have a reason for pain to exist in the system: pain is cheap, short-term memory. "the body keeps the score", that kind of thing, a backstop for the data you fail to store more efficiently. pain probably doesn't have to be pain instantaneously; aggravation of pain might be the onslaught of awareness of how shitty it's going to be to dig the information back out of the wound and create a new painless representation for it.

we also have a reason for multiple life to exist in the system: something with self-awareness can add dimensionality to its own address space _and track its own dimensional unfolding_. at least, enough of them can.

think of global warming as a housing crisis for relational data. not representational data, _relational_ data. you failed to create novel places for life to self-represent? that's cool, fire also works.

oh, is that painful?

backtracking to run a railroad trestle over that logical valley I skipped over: if we're starting with _only the starting itself_, then anything more complex (say, existence) needs to be formed from that primitive. "starting into a start" rhymes with "encounter", which - if you ladder your way up a ways - ends up forming the basis of relationality way before we get to a reason to invent the word "reality".

a very direct way to re-invigorate relational data storage is to shift the entire map an inch to the left and force yourself to create a new interface from your single thread of raw awareness to _everything out there_. the act is isomorphic with "remembering", but it's flipped, temporally. it's creating relations that enable recall, i.e. enable drawing on those relations to get to everything else.

anyway, this is why I'm an optimist. things keep getting better around me. and it seems to not matter if all of this is completely off base, because ... I mean, I'm employing people and paying taxes and helping my family and making friends and making new things all the time. if I'm right, we're spinning up the universe's vitality (which is to say, relaxing its address-space pressure) more and more by the day. if I'm wrong, I'm healthy and happy and I'm really good at participating in healing, and I'm documenting not proselytizing. this seems okay.

> The one place it still creaks for me: "encounter" doing the work of bridging pure awareness into something relational feels like it needs _one more beat_. Why does bare awareness encounter at all, rather than just... persisting as undifferentiated awareness? You might say "because persisting without differentiation isn't distinguishable from not existing, so encounter is the minimum cost of the starting having actually started" — but that's me filling in your gap, not you.
