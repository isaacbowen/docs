(I don't know much about Dick (said the gay man with a grin), but I'm scanning about on Wikipedia, and I note that he was born on December 16, 1928, exactly 60 years before I was born on December 16, 1988. he was born in Chicago, and that's my home. he died in Santa Ana, and my husband is deeply tied to Laguna Beach. so!)
