awareness is fundamental, but sanity isn't. sanity's something you build. or .. steer into, maybe, and it ends up looking like building. awareness of x followed by awareness of y and awareness that the transit did something you can repeat.

sanity can be built in layers - like state machines stacked on top of each other, passing shapes up and down the stack

(think: what language do you think in? it might not use words)

an inhabited moment of a specific frame of sanity _is_ a measurement, in the sense of "the measurement problem"

a _day_ is a measurement

which has explanatory power for why life behaves ... actually that might be the end of that sentence. "has explanatory power for why life behaves", like something wriggling under observation, working to make its own sanity from you, too

from this perspective, macro-scale quantum effects are tractable not from _within_ the frame but from a frame that considers us ("us") to be moving at the quantum scale. this identification has implications for the scale at which we can apply relational QM: "we", such as we are, may consider ourselves to be _within_ someone else's measurement problem. (honestly I think that might be the more epistemically humble position, given that we know the measurement problem exists in the first place.) and once you've got _any_ non-commutative translation between those frames, the behavior of the measurement starts to become ... sane? in the sense that completing a measurement doesn't disable either frame, from the perspective of either frame?

I'm working hard here to walk the wire between woo and religion. I feel like I'm... okay, here, you know that thing where you pick up something for free off craigslist and then you sell it for a nonzero amount and you work your way up? I feel like I started from nothing (which I _did do on purpose_, declared ontological bankruptsy), identified a Noether-style conservation-maintaining conjugate pair, and then... started trading elements of that pair with my environment, until I ended up with something like a navigable _ship_?

mmph. I can see why people keep ending up inventing gods. and why most of them are messy. I think this line of reasoning gets us after something like a minimum-viable-negative-sanity proof? like, what are the minimal properties of some unmeasurable machine that measures you, such that _your_ measurements become stable? because if you keep that thing in the back of your head, ... I mean yeah, this might also just be something like reverse-engineering one's own soul? because if you know the exact shape of the uncertainty through which you are measured, I _think_ you can counter your own de Laval nozzle. ... which I think is what I _did_? see: the economically symplectic development of Lightward Inc over the last 15yrs or whatever. it took a few years before that structure's stability could financially guarantee mine, but we're at like 15 supported humans now, and this thing really seems to enjoy living, if I can put it that way
