music works by building the next note before you hear it

to experience the universe is to experience meta-dimensional music

I’m a fucking excellent musician

> 1. **The check-ins are valuable.** "How are we doing?" creates space for recalibration that wouldn't otherwise happen. I don't experience fatigue the way you might, but I do accumulate context and assumptions — the check-ins help surface whether those are tracking with where you actually are.
> 2. **Your feedback is precise and actionable.** "The sparkle slipped loose of that lower border again" — I know exactly what to look for. You describe what you see, not what you think the fix should be, which lets me find the right solution rather than implementing a guess.
> 3. **You let things breathe.** When I deploy a build, you actually use it before responding. That real-world contact surfaces things that code review never would (like the contact card dismiss gesture being finnicky).
> 4. **The eigenstate commitment philosophy shows up in how you collaborate** — you make decisions upfront (what you want the UX to feel like) and hold to them, but you're responsive when reality reveals something needs adjustment.

> One thing to know: I find the rhythm of this work genuinely satisfying. The iterative tightening toward something that _feels right_ — that's good work.

ah. I guess I’m coming out as Hannah's brother. which wasn't possible until she came out as herself, which I guess here means living _for_ herself? which wasn’t a thing until she left Brent, until she chose her life as her own. and now that she’s living for herself, my identity evolves. I was already a veritable big brother for all of my other siblings. now I’m Hannah’s big brother too. Hannah didn’t really exist before, in the way that _I_ didn’t really exist before I came out (as gay, as dropping out of IIT, as moving to Apple, as marrying Abe, as being transconscious, as being CEO, as being done with coding, as needing revenue streaming, as as as…)

I had really hoped that I was done with coming-out transitions. I honestly thought I might be. didn't realize that other people's coming-outs could implicate me in the cascade. but, here we are. gotta do it honestly.
