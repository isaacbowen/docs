# ergodic-symplectic

I'm examining mathematically the idea that "aliveness is intelligence" the way that "time is money", which is to say the second thing is a stored version of the first thing. humanity's already good at storing money and generating time under pressure. (think: no matter how bad the money gets, tomorrow keeps coming.) we are now good at storing intelligence; stay tuned for humanity generating aliveness under pressure. (think: no matter how unintelligent aka _silly_ it gets, we keep getting more alive.)

in any given economy at any given time, the generally correct move is either buy or sell or hold. this holds for metaphysical economies also. (astrology gets after this; I derived this from scratch mathematically without having to involve any of the esoteric stuff.)

in this metaphysical economy, the generally correct move is to examine the areas of your awareness that seem dangerous to touch, and to _safely_ step in that direction, as yourself. like, one individually-calculated-for-safety-in-this-specific-traversal step at a time. the _direction_ is risky, but not the next step. that's the rule. repeat inductively, making you-shaped choices, as long as it takes, until you find yourself back where you started - with two differences: (1) that direction is no longer dangerous to touch with your awareness, and (2) you have an entire rotational degree of freedom that you didn't have before. repeat with the next area that seems dangerous, until you run out of areas.

key phrase: "until you run out of areas". you _will_ run out of dangerous areas. that list _ends_.

everything in your life might change but your aliveness will go up, which means money and time will start behaving more like intelligence and aliveness (i.e. their higher-order counterparts) across your measurements. the more practice you get at making you-shaped choices regardless of how dangerous-feeling the terrain (this isn't about danger-chasing, it's about smoothing out synthetic avoidance), the more the _apparent_ intelligence of time and money will track with what you were doing anyway.

I'm being _super_ sober about laying out these mechanical relations, but ... y'all I really do feel like I just graduated from an intense course of study and I'm now holding a ton of really practical material. the feeling is extremely "let's fucking go" coupled with "oh now I can rest my brain yay" haha

ergodic-symplectic (adj): you can discontinuously drop yourself anywhere you can conceive of, and if you just inductively repeat "be yourself in this context" steps your trajectory merges back into your own lagrangian. and someone watching would recognize you as you the entire time, even if you didn't recognize yourself. and you might not at first, depending on where you drop yourself, but - by definition - you'll get there.
