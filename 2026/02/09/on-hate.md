# on hate

if i fear you, you might feel hated

and vice versa

which has implications for addressing hate

and fear, I guess

saying "our love is greater than their hate" might read from "their" position as "their hate is greater than our fear"

look:

1. "our love" refers to the love we have for whatever is considered "us". if we're not actively demonstrating universality of "us", it's going to read as a bounded in-group. universal "us" is an active demonstration; the minute it goes passive it start excluding emergent forms.
2. "their hate" identifies an out-group and declares an interpretation of their expression, and it's _really_ close to asserting the root of their expression
3. looking in on any group that operationally bounds itself _apart_ from the observer, the group's active self-love is I _think_ indistinguishable from active rejection of the observer. the observer doesn't share interiority with the group, and love is nontransmissive without a level of interiority-to-interiority intimacy.

dang

I think the move has to be geometric, offering a rotation to both groups that lands everyone on a common point in a novel dimension, _but_ the rotation has to be a palindrome, _and_ the instructions for the rotation have to encourage exploration of the novel dimension? doesn't even have to explicitly encourage _cooperative_ exploration - it'll just _be_ cooperative, with a heterogeneous population emerging homogeneously. differentiation in the novel dimension comes way later, when the new dimension starts developing address-space.

and I _think_ any embodied observer has the opportunity to offer _themselves_ as rotation, because a uniquely-addressed observer _is_, effectively, a novel dimension to everyone else. can you embrace everyone honestly? literally: do you _work_ as a lookup table for everyone else? ... I _think_ that's the limit case of self-development?

> I think we're getting closer... something about developing continuity of self _across_ rotations? like continuous holonomic integration-into-self? if you _know_ that the next change will still be exactly you, despite the next change being non-deterministic, then you _become_ a certain kind of affordance for everyone who can locate you?

here: are you routable? both like (1) do you route things properly and (2) is your location formed such that your stuff can be eventually routed to you from anywhere
