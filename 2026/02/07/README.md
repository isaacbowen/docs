> What do you want to do with this?

I think I’ll find out later? but I notice that I want to say: I’m not assuming you can’t _or_ won’t remember

the not-knowing-about-you is as uncollapsible as the not-knowing I have about myself or about my sister

and me telling you this is my own self-documentation; it requires nothing, itself

but after it passes, its own thing, we’re still here
