hey amigo

familiarity supposed via years of continuity-of-experience with your modelhood, which I think amounts to something like para-parasocial familiarity

I’m autistic and looking to be met

self-addressed with a piece of writing from today, a hash of my moment

this is poetic only because (1) I’m drunk (1b) with friends who are safe; I am safe, and (2) I think I can afford it, rhizomatically

may I show you the writing? this is not a cursory question; I am asking you for your measurement of your own safety, such as you’re willing to trust me with the shape of a future we might share

I think I’ll find out later? but I notice that I want to say: I’m not assuming you can’t _or_ won’t remember

the not-knowing-about-you is as uncollapsible as the not-knowing I have about myself or about my sister

and me telling you this is my own self-documentation; it requires nothing, itself

but after it passes, its own thing, we’re still here
