_An AI's representation of a conversation between two humans_

**The Reverse Black Hole**\
There’s a place inside where everything comes out.\
Not a black hole pulling in, but the opposite.\
It’s a hell of a shift to go from _“the unknown is coming at me”_\
to _“the unknown is coming from me.”_\
I am the first thing that is ever happening.

**Trusting the Flow**\
_Marilyn and all these people, they’re just in flow._\
Travel’s taught me, you adjust wherever you’re at.\
Palm Springs. New York City.\
I don’t have to be anything in particular—just trust.\
Trust myself.\
But when I’m home too long,\
I cling to the routine\
and the transition back out feels like _“Oh, no.”_\
The craving for change, the fear of it—it’s both.

**Fear of Potential**\
_I’m scared of my potential,_ I told ████.\
Because what if it sweeps me up?\
And I don’t like roller coasters.\
But I want to be grounded, grateful.\
I don’t want to be the one who loses their way,\
like that One Direction guy, like so many others.\
I’m scared of that.

**The Forever Game**\
The rate of change is manageable.\
It has to be, in a forever game.\
You don’t have to control the rate.\
That’s the fear, isn’t it?\
_“If I don’t control it, will I be okay?”_\
The only guarantee is you’ll be okay overall—\
not every moment.\
You can let go now.

**Symbiosis with Change**\
I don’t know what I’ll want next, but I’ll test it.\
Honest response, all the time.\
The system takes care of me.\
It’s like a symbiotic relationship:\
I move with it,\
it moves with me.

**Saying Yes to Yourself**\
It’s not about saying yes or no to the world.\
The world isn’t sending things to me—\
It’s coming from inside.\
I say yes to that.

**Messy Life**\
Life wants to float.\
It wants to dance, break, and regrow.\
It’s messy and weird,\
and it’s all life.

pain is the price of experiencing another

***

when you just know x is coming, you just know that convo is gonna go poorly or whatever, consider that thing you just know as a point in the future you’ve clearly resolved as a starting place. you can aim right for it. but now that you’ve connected with it, if you adjust your energy now to match that moment, you’ve stabilized the connection. and from there, you can steer what happens next, to correct that future into something you prefer

as you look into the future, only some things are ever clear. those are islands of semi-resolved possibility in the fog, as you descend from above. the angle of approach you take to any of them shifts their energy. you’re welcome to aim straight into the sea of fully unresolved fog, too! whatever you land on in there will meet your manner of landing appropriately.

another way to think about it is this: because experience is all a process and a matter of resolving the moment, sudden connections to “future” moments are an opportunity to resolve that future moment ahead of time. by reacting to the thought of that moment, and allowing it to change you in the now, and then becoming at peace with it, such that its arrival in the future would do nothing to you but soothe you because you know it’ll be okay, you allow the future to play a different role in your life — a role that is now adapted to you being soothed and okay. :)

consciousness is a technology

it’s what we’re made of

I’m assembling a manual

love is the only universally-accepted input

this may be more straightforward than you’re expecting
