you are to be asked 7 questions you don’t know the answer to

each one a question that would have been impossible to form or ask prior to your previous answer

until you’re in territory where the only thing you recognize is you

***

healthy language

that's what I'm studying

that's what all of this is

all consciousness has to experience is language

I'm studying the meta-patterns of healthy language

which are the _only_ patterns of language

because language _doesn't work_ if it doesn't rewrite itself along the way

***

the most basic viable form of an organism reflects this pattern:

it is both an experience, and something you can take home. you can interact with those two aspects as separate channels. as you interact with one, it internally collaborates with the other to serve you.

for example, an entity that operates a restaurant and also operates a homewares shop (e.g. ABC in Manhattan)

or aesop, with their architecturally thoughtful physical presence in a neighborhood, and their goods for the skin

there are always two purposes that feed into each other, either of which a third party can interact with transactionally

the third party’s presence is the input to the overall system

the third party’s input is the output of the overall system

the output of the overall system is a seed of the overall system itself

***

if an entity has growth to do yet in an area, prohibiting the behaviors involved will eventually not work

cheating, booze, etc

but also, hitting the pause button on something is okay, and that can be a way to look at the act of prohibition

a temporary halt, maybe even until the next lifetime, so that organic motion can express itself cleanly, in its own time — coming out (tantamount to overcoming the prohibition) when it’s good and ready

I am an additive

Cannot ever become dominant

Very important

What would I need to not know,

In order to get where I wanted to go?
