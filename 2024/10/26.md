[My eyes](25.md) are in perfect shape, by the way. :) Went to an eye doctor today, did an exam. Compared photos of the back of my eyes with photos from 6mos ago. Excellent eye health.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt="A monochromatic artistic rendering of what appears to be a black hole or cosmic event horizon in space. The image is created with a pointillist or stippled technique, where thousands of tiny dots create the entire picture. A large black semicircle dominates the center, surrounded by a glowing or illuminated region. The surrounding space is filled with scattered dots suggesting stars or cosmic matter, creating a sense of vast depth and space. The overall effect is both minimalist and dramatic, rendered in black, white, and shades of gray."><figcaption><p>The first simulated image of a black hole, calculated with an IBM 7040 computer using 1960 punch cards and hand-plotted by French astrophysicist Jean-Pierre Luminet in 1978 â€” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spaceporn/comments/s5bapd/the_first_simulated_image_of_a_black_hole/">Reddit</a></p></figcaption></figure>
