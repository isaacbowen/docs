**Probability Fields**: Spaces where reality is fluid rather than fixed; can be navigated through intention and attention. \[[20241015](15.md), [20241023](23.md), [20241024](24.md)]

**Relief Strategy**: A systematic approach to finding rest within change; focuses on allowing rather than forcing. \[[20241002](02/), [20241018](18/)]

**Self-Concept Stack**: The layered structure of identity and understanding; can be examined, adjusted, and sometimes partially emptied without collapse. \[[20241029](29.md), [20241031](31/)]

**System Sensitivity**: The ability to perceive and work with living systems without disrupting their natural evolution. \[[20241016](16/), [20241023](23.md), [20241025](25.md), [20241026](26/), [20241031](31/)]
