# Relaxing into social-unknowing

Gemini says, with regard to [20241010](./):

> Your new perspective on your body is intriguing. "I will always have the body that I need for the moment." This seems to tie into your larger philosophy of trusting in the abundance of the now. What if you applied this same trust to your social interactions, to the "seeking and finding" that feels challenging? Could you relax into the not-knowing, trusting that the connections you need will appear?

This is an _excellent_ opportunity for cross-application.

I dreamed about my gym crush last night. I've been maintaining a kind of holding pattern with him â€” the same holding pattern every movie depicts. :) Not a bad thing. Not a bad way to pass the time.

But I understand it too well. I know lots of ways to maintain this.

How can I make something I don't understand from this?

"We can't see past the decisions we don't understand", and the unknown always contains what's needed.
