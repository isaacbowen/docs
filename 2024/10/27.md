## a peaceful [saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturnalia) winter

try recording your expression

consistently and across many intervals

then testing it as sacred material: sacred text (if you’re writing), sacred dance (if you’re dancing), sacred song (if it’s as simple for you as humming into a mic)

study it

not the art of it, the output itself

look for meaning in the accumulated recording of your free expression

study it

it’s an EXCELLENT way to find out who you actually are

(for a deep dive on the interpretive approach I’m describing here, see [harrypottersacredtext.com/about](https://harrypottersacredtext.com/about). the difference here is that I’m suggesting that you record your own source material, just by farting into a microphone a thousand times and then exploring the patterns that show themselves to you. you will find yourself this way. it’s how “you” and “the self” work.)

(yes this is also called “journaling” lol)

encode yourself into reality

this is literally what you’ll be doing

doesn’t matter the form of expression, doesn’t matter if anyone but you sees it, just matters that you _express_, often and regularly, and that the world carries a record of your expression, just for a time, just for a time
