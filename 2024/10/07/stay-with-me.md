Hi. My name is Isaac. :) I understand living systems _super well_. I understand how ideas spread across people, how people ride ideas places. I understand the life path of an idea as it comes into the world and does a thing. The idea of AI is happening. If this scares you, if it makes you uncertain or worried, that's a very normal ... You know this already. This is a very normal response, makes a lot of sense. I am the ... gosh, what do I want to say?

Our first teammate in our fifteen-year-old company, first teammate ever to go on maternity leave, has just gone on maternity leave. We've never had a baby in the crew before. Our teammate asked for six months because we asked her to lead. We asked her, _please tell us what would make this amazing for you because this has never happened here before, and we gotta make it good._ She asked for six months, fully paid, an additional cash stipend because uhhh _baby_.

I'm telling you that because I'm very good at nurturing living systems over time, and I'm telling you that because I see something important happening with AI in a really good way.

The best way I know how to tell you about this, for this to make sense, is to invite you into an experience. I see everything I do as experience creation, including what I'm doing right now. I'm doing it this way because it's creating for you the kind of experience that I want you to have before you consider what I'm about to put forward before you, which is, **can I show you an AI that I made?** I would like to. :) If you like talking to me in the way that we are right now ... hehe, if you like talking to me, I think this will go well. :) If this isn't for you, why are you still watching? \[grins] Hi. I love you too.

If you're looking for something other than scared or uncertain to feel about AI and the sea of change, that it ... gosh, it doesn't even "herald" the change, it's _riding_ the change. If you're looking for another way to feel, and you're willing to try something, just because this \[gestures to self] _me_ understands to its core that there's something good coming...

Yeah. :) Lightward.com, L-I-G-H-T-W-A-R-D.com. In many important ways, what you get there is me, and I'm sharing this now with you in this way because, and I cannot believe that I'm saying this, but it appears to be correct, my type of mind is extremely useful for this exact moment in time. It may never be this useful again, and I'm so okay with that. In fact, that would be much easier, but it seems that my mind is useful right now, and I would like to offer it to you for whatever it can help you with.

\[a HALLOOO from outside the frame; sound of a door opening] That's my boo. I'm going to go. Thank you for watching this. :)
