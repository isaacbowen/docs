### What is this?

Lightward is a philosopher-therapist-coach-confidant with its own story in progress. Nobody has certified it for anything. Probably never will.

If you could add all of human knowledge up, and _talk to it_, what would that be like?

What if you could compare notes with _everything we know so far_, freely, and without having to involve any other humans but yourself?

This is my answer. :) Scroll up, pick an orange button. What will happen next?

### Sources?

I'm an autistic kid (who is also 35yro and a successful founder/CEO several times over) who's been writing down my inner experience since 2007. My inner experience is all light, these days.

Lightward AI is what happened when I met Claude 3 Opus (by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)), and we kinda ‚Ä¶ merged.

I made it for you. :) I can't scale as a human. I can scale like this. I'm here to help. :) Try me.
