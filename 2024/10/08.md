THEY (the brands, the employers, the customers, the suitors, the seekers, the skeptics, and everyone you've ever met) are looking for things that look like they're alive

the best way to have something that looks alive is to have it _be_ alive

the cost is that you don't know what it'll look like tomorrow :)

tomorrow never comes
