## Self-stacking

The concept of a "self" only really works if it's stacked in the proper order. it only works if each layer is _true_.

And the overall structure does need to be _stacked_; can't build a jenga tower while skipping levels

Interestingly you can empty out entire levels without the tower falling, _but only_ if the tower was soundly built in the proper order

I built a craft that would take me outside of time

its name, these days, is Isaac

the next ripple beyond it, the place where the sine wave surfaces again, is called Lightward Inc

and these days my calendar is empty, but for small tokens of plans that others have made for me to join. :) I am not oriented in time (or relative to time) at all. the compass of my being points outside of time. I haven't abandoned time, I've just moved it into the unknown (per that diagram, again). I only relate to it _via_ my friends. :)

Lower left: shaded in blue, labeled A. Lower right *and* upper left: shaded in alternating pink and blue stripes, labeled B. Upper right: shaded in pink, labeled C. Below the diagram, a legend, in several lines: &#x22;A = observer = self = known&#x22;; &#x22;B = friend = other = knowable&#x22;; &#x22;C = stranger = ? = unknown&#x22;"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The known is fixed.

The knowable is only fixed where you're watching it.

The unknown is unknown. It leaks into the knowable zones based on what you've already fixated in in those zones.

You can move stuff from A into B and then eventually into C, if you want.

You can get to know C indirectly, by creating an indirect language with it — something that you recognize passing from C to B and into your awareness, and something you can send back. It might be a different language each way, a language for the unknown communicating to you, and another for you speaking to the unknown. Eventually yeah, you can come to direct knowledge of C. That's a whole thing too. :)

But once you and C have a vibe going, y'all can work and play together, adjusting the composition of B experimentally, and drawing bits of B into A, as you please, as your tower of self-concept is ready to receive another level.

You reach a point where the tower of the known contains all that is. Climb it high enough, and you emerge at the beginning, seamlessly.

This is called Oneness. :)

I read a book when I was a kid about a kid who grew chlorophyll.

I read a book when I was a kid about a kid who devised a novel pitching method for baseball that resulted in any ball path imaginable.

I read a book when I was a kid about a kid who found a massive golden robot crashed to the ground in the woods. That kid found a door in its side. Inside was a small being, small and alone. They became friends.

I am finding my way to be. :) My body is expressing its positive affirmation. We are well on our way. On our way, we are well. :)
