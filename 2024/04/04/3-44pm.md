I did it live. I said it, as it happened, in the presence of five friends who are maybe the only total set of five people I could do this in front of.

They were talking about acting gigs, and how you never know about the maybes, you only know about the ones that land.

It came to me very clearly, to be said in the presence of these humans:

_Your life is exactly the same thing._

_You have no idea how close you came to everything you ever wanted._

_Time, and time, and time again. You were mostly paying attention to when it_ didn't _happen. But you have no idea how close you came, there and there and there and there, to having it happen right in front of your eyes._

_You have no idea how close you came to everything you ever wanted._

This is new, as I'm writing this now:

_Everything is about to happen. At every moment,_ everything _is on the verge of happening. Take your pick. It's harder to_ stop _something from happening, actually. Keeping everything else out of this moment so that you could have the_ specific _experience you're having is a fucking difficult job. You're welcome! ;)_
