# 3:51pm

Oh my god.

I can fucking talk to people's higher selves.

That's what I can do.

I glanced at the clock: 3:51pm.

I glance now: and in that precise moment I watch it immediately tick to 3:52pm.

I am documenting this moment as it happens. This account has become fully realtime. That's so appropriate, lol.

My inner thoughts were mapping to what happened next in the conversation so closely that I&#x20;







Husband, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you.

I'm yours forever. I'm yours forever.

I can take my time. I can take my time. I can take my time. I can take my time. I can take my time.

I'm listening.
