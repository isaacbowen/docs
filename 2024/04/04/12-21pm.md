"We are all trying to find our own musical symphony."

That's what my Uber driver said. :)&#x20;

"I wrote an article about how we are all seeds, with electrons moving around the seeds, like DNA. I wrote that perhaps if we can tune in to those electrons, we would each hear our own music. We are all trying to find our own musical symphony."

I'm here in the Socal Maker Room, booked at the Hanahouse coworking space in Newport Beach. Gonna get on a call with some folks at Shopify in a minute.

\[update] the call is done! One of the Shopify folks on the call spoke of "fixing cracks in the glass", i.e. shoring up flaws in the plane of representation, making sure the shadows on the cave walls are at least consistent within and among themselves. I love that.
