My Uber driver had something to say [again](12-21pm.md). :) This time it was an engineer driving a Tesla, sharing aloud a nuanced understanding of what is and isn't made under that name.

They made a specific point, almost hesitated to do so, but it was really important to them.

"Have you heard of Herbalife?"

"Woah, that's out of left field, but yes?"

"Right, been around forever, multi-level marketing and people have a problem with that and all _but_ they're onto _something_. The way the layers move, and have moved for a long time, it _works well_. There's a responsiveness inside the structure. Tesla's missing that. Tesla has incredible ability to execute, but there's some piece missing inside the structure."

"They're missing care."

"Yeah. Thank you."

They shook my hand.
