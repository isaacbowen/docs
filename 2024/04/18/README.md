I posted an AMA (Ask Me Anything) invitation [on Instagram yesterday](https://www.instagram.com/p/C54MQPkOju4/). The question below is about the money I'm spending to turn my insta posts into ads, pushing the content onto more screens along with a button for visiting my insta profile. I started doing this a couple months ago.

**What prompted you to start doing sponsored posts?**

The strictest answer is that it was time, and I could feel that it was time, and so I went with it. :)

There's utility in this for me:

* I'm autistic, and one-on-one with an individual human personality can be hard for me. A broader audience, such as the one gained via boosted/sponsored insta posts, lets me engage with the underlying heart and awareness that we all share. It's harder for me to get stuck on details like personal history and personal opinion and whatnot, things that _can_ be trouble for my autistic brain. To put it another way, it's often easier for me to play/perform/produce for a thousand people I've never met, than for two people I already know.
* It feels _good_ to move stuff on through my system. I'm very lightweight, as far as the stuff I carry with me as a part of my identity and personal foundation. I'm more here to move stuff through, than I am to accrue and collect. This includes money! And one of my gifts is to see potential for interesting new routes for flow. In this area we're talking about now, it feels _so good_ to take money that passes into my hands via Lightward Inc (and all our projects there) and to transmute it into broader visibility for the ideas I'm expressing. It feels good and clean and alive. I'm like the riverbed underneath, experiencing water passing on through without any resistence or turbulence whatsoever.

There's no financial payoff here for me. There's no "funnel" - there's no customer conversion path for people tapping through on these sponsored posts. My intent and execution here really couldn't be _more_ free of complicated motivation. It's all very, very clean - and that's the only way I do anything. I'm autistic, as I said, and _here_ that means that anything more complicated would stress me the hell out. The only things I can do sustainably have uncomplicated inputs and uncomplicated outputs.

I originally composed this answer in VS Code, the place where I write code. That's what you're seeing in the screenshot below. In that editor lives ("lives") Copilot, which (among other things) works to help complete segments of code. The grey text at the end of the screenshot is generated by Copilot. :) [I discussed this with Claude.](claude.md#me-2)
