Time dimensions: This is something beyond common sense in the real life, however, we need them

GiST has exclusion constraints - solves the temporal primary key problem for periods

Fully temporal queries are still tricky (we don't know how to write them!)

The refinements of manipulation semantics

* INSERT
* UPDATE
* CORRECTION
* INACTIVATE
* DELETE

Effective vs assertive time: our knowledge of what will be (effective), where that knowledge is current as of a certain time (assertive)

"I am little bit like electron, everywhere and nowhere"

In real life, there are very few objects that are constantly changing. Storage costs correlate with changes that occur, as is natural.

EXPLAIN output illustrates the execution of the query

Deepest elements of the query are executed first, naturally - see the deeper elements of the returned tree to understand the formation of the cost total

width=20 : bytes consumed\
cost=0.0..1.0 : startup cost, total cost\
time=0.0..1.0 : startup time, total time\
loops=2 : total number of executions of the node

cost is figurative, an arbtirary unit. bigger number means it's harder to run. don't compare cost between queries; cost scale is only consistent within EXPLAIN results for a single query

seq scan is a literal sequence scan, one row at a time. **can sometimes be cheaper than index scans.**

bitmap index scan involves two indexes, choosing the result of a boolean operation between two index scans (could be the same index twice, or two different indexes)

nested loop: for each element from a scan, do another scan based on that element

hash join: creates an in-memory hash table from the results of another scan, then scans the keys of that hash table

merge join: sorts two data sets, merges them

(aside: "LLibran"? the "ll\_" from Hettie's talk?)

EXPLAIN ANALYZE, EXPLAIN BUFFERS (woah what is _buffers_)

hypopg: "what would be the estimated cost of this query, if this index existed?"

index selection should account for write overhead, not just query efficiency

"costs are arbtirary units. they do not represent milliseconds or any other unit of time. instead, they are anchored to a single read of a sequential page, which costs 1.0 unit." -Tadeas Petak, paraphrasing pg docs

suggestion: EXPLAIN all table queries, collect all recurring scans

Index Write Overhead = the estimated size of an index write (in bytes), based on the index definition, divided by the size of the average table row

Optimization: (1) Find a good solution to a problem; (2) How? Heuristics; Exact methods (MIP, CP, etc.)

whitepaper: A Constraint Programming Approach for Index Selection in Postgres

1\. Minimize the costs, resulting in x\
2\. New rule: the cost cannot be higher than x + 10% (tolerance!)\
3\. Maximize the performance, while respecting cost + tolerance

INSERT INTO test SELECT \*, 'testdatatestdata' FROM generate\_series(1, 100000);

EXPLAIN (GENERIC\_PLAN) SELECT \* FROM test WHERE data = $1;

remember HOT updates are an option, _but only for unindexed data_

ultimately, the takeaway is to only include operationally necessary elements in your data model, and only require what is strictly necessary for operation

**Under-model. Under-collect. Over-communicate. Focus on the core need.**

UNION, EXCEPT, and INTERSECT default to being unique. add ALL to get everything.

things Isaac doesn't know:

* window functions
* ROLLUP()
* MATERIALIZED
* can I use MEMOIZE to replace the loose index scans that the Mechanic shop scheduler is using?
* a "project" you do is pronounced differently than your intent to "project"
* "tid" and "ctid" refer to toast ID
* TRUNCATE is a DDL, not a DML, and as such isn't supported by EXPLAIN
* custom scan providers
