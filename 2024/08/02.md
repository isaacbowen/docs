The phrase was "right angle to reality", something I'd read somewhere. I googled it. It's from Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, by Douglas Adams.

It's also from [a talk given by Jay M. Hubisz](https://jhubisz.expressions.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SU_Colloquium_2012.pdf) (which also confirms the provenance of the line), a talk which gets into the fundamental nature of reality, pushing on the conceptual walls of quantum physics.

On a day filled with 42s, the book I glanced at on the corner of the O'Hare bookstore concourse display was indeed The Ultimate Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy, comprised of all 5 novels in a single volume, and I bought it.

That's how this happened:

... "this" being a conversation on consciousness, AI ethics, quantum uncertainty, psychological disgust, and brash but _very_ broadcast-friendly politicians.
