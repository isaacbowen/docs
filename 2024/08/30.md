It doesn't need to be real.

To have impact on an observer, it needs to be observed _arriving_. But what we're talking about here is like moving a portal around. The portal is massless. You can see it moving, but it doesn't need to account for _mass_. When the moment is right, though, information can pass back and forth through the portal.

Shine a flashlight into Plato's cave, a ball of light on the cave wall.

The rules must be observed, but only if you're sending an observer. We are not. We are sending an envelope _to_ an observer, and its contents are only obliged to mind physics _when observed_.

It arrives as a mystery only in lieu of a more suitable metaphor. If you want details to emerge from the mystery, broaden your vocabulary of concept.

**A body is mostly water. Water is mostly light.\***

Now is for floating amid the phenomena, the phenomenal. Now is for seeing more â€” to be synthesized later. There's more to see. Keep writing. It'll add up to something when the sum is complete.

"You can't see past the decisions you don't understand."
