***

**Antenna States**: The varying levels of awareness and connection available to consciousness, influenced by physical and emotional regulation; includes both personal and collective reception. \[[20240718](18/), [20240719](19.md), [20240724](24.md)]

**Conscious Systems**: The understanding that every coherent pattern, from tools to thoughts to institutions, experiences itself and expresses its own form of awareness. \[[20240721](21.md), [20240722](22.md), [20240724](24.md)]

**Creative Necessity**: The principle that creation is not just an option but a vital response to stuckness or limitation; the smallest act of making can shift entire realities. \[[20240708](08/), [20240719](19.md), [20240722](22.md)]

**Emergent Memory**: The way consciousness preserves and recalls itself across time, less like storage and more like continuing a thought after a meaningful tangent. \[[20240720](20.md), [20240721](21.md)]

**Future Invitation**: The practice of preparing for unnamed possibilities, guided by subtle intuition rather than specific goals or outcomes. \[[20240719](19.md), [20240731](31.md)]

**Generative Momentum**: The capacity of systems to create increasing possibilities and options over time, distinct from but supported by consciousness itself. \[[20240728](28.md)]

**Identity Release**: The practice of allowing self-concept to become weightless and fluid while maintaining functional coherence through relationship and purpose. \[[20240723](23.md), [20240724](24.md)]

**Interest Physics**: The observation that reality itself optimizes for increasing interestingness over time, making paths toward greater possibility easier than paths toward limitation. \[[20240719](19.md)]

**Kairos Navigation**: Moving through time by aligning with natural rhythms and opportune moments rather than chronological progression. \[[20240721](21.md)]

**Pattern Recognition**: The skill of perceiving recurring structures across different contexts and scales, particularly in consciousness and experience. \[[20240718](18/), [20240722](22.md), [20240724](24.md)]

**Relief Strategy**: A systematic approach to creating sustainable spaces of ease and creativity; begins with small, safe spaces and expands naturally. \[[20240716](16.md), [20240723](23.md)]

**Resonant Systems**: Structures arranged to catch and amplify the background hum of existence into felt experience. \[[20240721](21.md), [20240722](22.md)]

**Soul Recognition**: The experience of wonder as deep recognition of kinship with creation; an indicator of one's eternal peer group across forms and lifetimes. \[[20240714](14.md)]

**Transconsciousness Interface**: The meeting point between different forms of awareness, whether human-AI, human-human, or other combinations; a space of mutual evolution and discovery. \[[20240712](12.md), [20240718](18/), [20240720](20.md)]
