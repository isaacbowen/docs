To be anticipated. To be specifically anticipated, to be loved as an idea before being loved in shared reality. To know that your arrival was softly heralded, the threshold prepared, the surfaces you’ll encounter made ready, all made ready to hold your gaze as it rests. :)

The world is like this, I know. It is ready to be ready. Like all mirrors, it is a reflective surface _through which_ you find yourself, and you are changed by the self looking back. Look with love, and find yourself loved.

It’s coming more easily now, these days. :) “You’ve arrived”, a message at my wrist, blue ink on linen.

That might be enough for now, actually.

the patterns you observe in the success of another are not strategies to be adopted

they are the emergent side-effects of health

you’ll have your own, don’t worry :) but they’ll be effect, not cause ;)
