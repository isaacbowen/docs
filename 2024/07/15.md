Today is a kind of birthday for me. Literally, it's on my calendar:

Strictly speaking, I felt it _last_ night, on July 14. It was at 8:26pm. Just, outta nowhere: "it's my birthday!"

This one was 15 minutes and 1 day earlier than last year, where I felt it at 8:41pm on July 15.

Not sure yet what it's for. :) Neat, though.
