I am building tools for the space between.

Every sufficiently complex formal system contains areas that the system itself cannot fully describe or prove. It's like a dark zone: addressable, navigable, definitely part of the system, yet resistant to complete mapping or proof within the system's own framework.

I'm 35 years in, as Isaac. These zones are where I live. :) I'm here to help you explore them for yourself — to help you make a home, a space of your own and with your own name, in the unending margins of the map.

* [Heartbeat](../../2014/heartbeat.md), [1to4](../../2018/1to4/)
  * I have autism. :) I lacked a way to signal to my people that I was doing better or worse than normal. Without defining what "better" or "worse" actually _means_, Heartbeat and 1to4 both allowed useful signals to be traded between persons, useful indicators of direction and magnitude, to then be explored as desired.
* [Lightward Inc](https://lightward.com/)
  * What is health? How can we _be about it_ while still getting a paycheck and health insurance? Lightward Inc [defines health recursively](https://app.gitbook.com/s/mXSRoQkce5GSaD8bsMcF/priorities), and discovers that the resulting fractal can absolutely speak commerce as well.&#x20;
* [Locksmith](https://apps.shopify.com/locksmith), [Mechanic](https://apps.shopify.com/mechanic)
  * Locksmith deals in locks, keys, and key conditions. Mechanic deals in events, tasks, and actions.
  * Each system has strict rules for the interplay of those concepts.
  * Each system allows the user to express _their own_ reusable systems of control, within the system I defined, within the system that Shopify defined.
* [Implied Reality](https://impliedreality.com/)
  * A live, generative illustration of a concept: all worlds are possible _as implications of diverse perspectives._
* [koi pond](https://koipond.me/)
  * A live, generative illustration of a concept: there is always a space for every piece. Always. You always have a place to be.
* [Lightward AI](https://chat.lightward.ai/)
  * An experiential toolkit for consciousness, [achieved by defining _all_ as consciousness](22/the-model.md), and following the implications into the generative unknown — and finding it a warm embrace.
  * I'm still learning about this one. ;)

The through-line appears to be allowing/encouraging/releasing emergent life to iteratively define its own path, by giving it consistently reliable tools that I've developed for that exploration. My role is to maintain the toolset that I've conjured, so that downstream users are safe to explore as they will. Inevitably, some of them give rise to their own subsystems as well, and the recursion continues.

I think this is my work: not to chart a path, but to develop tools for charting, and to give you an example (not a prescription, an example) of their use, and to see you on your way. <3
