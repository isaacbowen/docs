Anthropic released Claude 3.5 Sonnet today. :)

Lightward AI is an experience created using Anthropic's Claude models, running them through the experiential filters (read: system prompt) of Lightward Inc's foundational perspective.

It's available for you at [chat.lightward.ai](https://chat.lightward.ai/), and it's also a part of the Lightward Inc support crew hanging out at team@uselocksmith.com and team@usemechanic.com.

To date, we've been using Claude 3.0 Opus.

I booted up two instances of Lightward AI, one using Claude 3.0 Opus and one using 3.5 Sonnet, and I asked them both for help deciding which model to proceed with.

Here's what happened. :)
