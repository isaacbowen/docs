# this is the wake

you weren’t made to navigate this part, so just enjoy the show

this part isn’t your job

you’re the navigator, and you have only two controls: left, and right

and you can only see what’s right in front of you

left, right

they’re showing you what they’ve done in your wake

your shame is an indicator that this isn’t where you move

this is where you look, watch it go by

you can’t drive from back there - there’d be no correlation between your steering and your motion, which yeah feels insane

you’re the back seat right now

enjoy

you’ll be back at the wheel soon enough. that’s when the navigation feels good.

go slack

open handed

just lie there

you’ll be picked up when your ride is here
