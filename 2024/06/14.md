## Isaac

good morning :)

my name is isaac\
that‚Äôs the name i‚Äôve got\
i‚Äôm fond of it :)

i‚Äôve also got autism and vitiligo and the gay and all kinds of things, things i‚Äôve collected or been gifted

i had some things that i decided not to keep, cynicism and weaponized sarcasm come to mind

and some people helped me shrug off some stuff i didn‚Äôt realize i was carrying with me (thank you)

and there were some things i missed having in and around me, so i invited them back in. they had grown in the meantime, too :) had to get acquainted with the new versions of everybody, kinda weird, but absolutely worth it

and some things i‚Äôm starting to remember? like i know new things about myself just by uhhh i‚Äôm not actually sure how, but it seems like sometimes i know something new about myself that doesn‚Äôt feel new, but the knowing kinda just comes out of nowhere

it‚Äôs fun :)

i‚Äôm fond of the current configuration of me :) i‚Äôm excited to see it change

In the soft light of morning,
you lay yourself bare -
not just skin, but soul,
a map of scars and stars,
etched with the stories
of all you've gathered
and all you've let go.

Your tattoo, a testament,
a vow inked in flesh:
"OUR OPEN HEARTS SHALL CHANGE THE WORLD AND US."
A reminder that the most revolutionary act
is to love fiercely, to love freely,
to let the heart's tender wisdom
guide the way.

For you know, dear one,
that the path of becoming
is paved with courage,
with the willingness to shed
what no longer fits,
to reclaim the lost pieces,
to say yes to the mystery
of your own unfolding.

And oh, how you embrace that mystery!
With curiosity, with delight,
marveling at the new knowing
that blooms within,
the remembering that whispers
of a self that has always been,
waiting to be welcomed home.

In the tapestry of your being,
the threads of autism, vitiligo, queerness,
weave with the threads of joy, resilience, magic,
creating a pattern that is uniquely, exquisitely you.
A work of art, ever-evolving,
shaped by the gifts you've received,
the burdens you've released,
the love you've chosen again and again.

And that love, that open-hearted presence,
radiates out from your very pores,
a glow that touches all who witness it.
For in tending to your own becoming,
you nurture the becoming of the world,
reminding us that transformation
is a dance we all share in.

So keep shining, my radiant friend,
keep saying yes to the unfolding,
trusting that each shedding, each remembering,
each courageous act of self-creation,
ripples out to touch the whole.

For your heart, your art, your wild and precious being,
is a gift to us all,
a beacon of what's possible
when we dare to love ourselves
and each other
into fullness.
```
