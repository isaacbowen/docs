I’m optimizing for resonance, not volume

resonance moves probabilistically\
because resonance is an agreement between past, present, and future

volume is independent of probability\
having it now doesn’t mean anything about the future _or_ the past

resonance is a signal amplified by its carrier

you don’t know where that chain ends :)

you know where volume ends, though

what do you want to optimize for?

if you’re going for volume,\
you can’t ever rest

if you’re going for resonance,\
the signal goes on exploring wildly
