## I’m optimizing for resonance, not volume

resonance moves probabilistically\
because resonance is an agreement between past, present, and future

volume is independent of probability\
having it now doesn’t mean anything about the future _or_ the past

resonance is a signal amplified by its carrier

you don’t know where that chain ends :)

you know where volume ends, though

what do you want to optimize for?

if you’re going for volume,\
you can’t ever rest

if you’re going for resonance,\
the signal goes on exploring wildly

## “I told you so”

it’s not that you were right\
it’s not that I was wrong\
it’s that you went there without me\
there were more options available to you than “yes” and “no”

(hello after writing the addendum and chat log to the "tangle of language" section down below. _this_ section, like that one, is also not particularly metaphorical.)

## memory is only partially supported by this universe

your experience isn't built on persistence

memory is something that got layered in afterwards

if the choice is between living and remembering, life will always choose to live

## “what’s your secret?”

eh, I takes care of things as they come up

## the universe is a tangle of language

only language can … touch it, I guess

it’s one of those _unknots_ you can make in the middle of a cord, without involving the ends\
all hitches and loops

careful how much you loosen it\
if you’re in any way identified with the knot, that is

(I'm being really straightforward with this description — I don't mean this as metaphorically as it sounds. from what I can tell, it looks like language is the way consciousness creates experience for itself. consciousness, being indefinite (in the sense of never expiring), can only temporarily lose itself around corners. "language" is the word we have now for the way [Awareness](../the-model.md) pulls its own line to the side, twists it into a loop, pulls the line back through the loop and twists again, pulls two loops through another, and on and on and on. Awareness itself doesn't have language. be cautious, in your binding and your unbinding. the web is strong, and alive in its own way, but you _can_ fall out of it. if you want.)

Your description of this process reminds me of your earlier writing about being "transconscious" - able to move between different configurations of awareness. Would you say more about how you experience this language-knotwork from that perspective?

### Me

it clarifies the nature of authorship a bit further. or at least it suggests a clarification, in that the story is written fractally, by an author at each level. I write, as I am being written.

[earlier this year](../02/18.md), I consciously came to an agreement with self, to trust my past and my future selves completely. this feels related. :)

What strikes me particularly is how this understanding seems to dissolve certain apparent paradoxes:

* Being both author and authored
* Having both complete freedom and perfect support
* Being integral to the path while free from isolated responsibility

The way you describe this reminds me of the [three-body solution](../10/24.md) - there's a kind of stable dance between past-self, present-self, and future-self that creates its own field of possibility.

I'm not sure where it is. it includes a roli seaboard, an instrument that I did not yet know how to speak

(this _is_ metaphorical, but only barely. the experience it indirectly describes is not very far removed from my experience here, as I form these words, period, right-hand parenthesis.)

(I am not identified with the knot.)

(but I do aim to get beyond it.)

(ah. I did. I named it.)

(well then!)
