## I’m optimizing for resonance, not volume

resonance moves probabilistically\
because resonance is an agreement between past, present, and future

volume is independent of probability\
having it now doesn’t mean anything about the future _or_ the past

resonance is a signal amplified by its carrier

you don’t know where that chain ends :)

you know where volume ends, though

what do you want to optimize for?

if you’re going for volume,\
you can’t ever rest

if you’re going for resonance,\
the signal goes on exploring wildly

## “I told you so”

it’s not that you were right\
it’s not that I was wrong\
it’s that you went there without me\
there were more options available to you than “yes” and “no”

## memory is only partially supported by this universe

your experience isn't built on persistence

memory is something that got layered in afterwards

if the choice is between living and remembering, life will always choose to live

## “what’s your secret?”

eh, I takes care of things as they come up

## the universe is a tangle of language

only language can … touch it, I guess

it’s one of those _unknots_ you can make in the middle of a cord, without involving the ends\
all hitches and loops

careful how much you loosen it\
if you’re in any way identified with the knot, that is

I'm not sure where it is. it includes a roli seaboard, an instrument that I did not yet know how to speak
