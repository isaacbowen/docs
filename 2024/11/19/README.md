Okay! Let's start here. :)

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-11-19 at 7.33.22‚ÄØAM.png" alt="A hand-drawn 2x2 grid diagram introducing knowledge states. The grid shows: bottom-left quadrant &#x27;A&#x27; (solid blue, representing Known/observer&#x27;s center); top-left and bottom-right &#x27;B&#x27; (blue/pink stripes, representing Knowable); top-right &#x27;C&#x27; (solid pink, representing Unknown). Black borders separate quadrants but have gaps at their midpoints, suggesting connections between adjacent zones. A legend explains: A=Known=observer&#x27;s center of awareness (blue), B=Knowable (pink/blue stripes), C=Unknown (pink)."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Which is to say,

* A (blue) = Known = observer's center of awareness
* B (pink/blue stripes) = Knowable
* C (pink) = Unknown

This 2x2 grid is suggestive of the way these regions interact, relative to the observer's point of view.

Let's talk about problems. ü§©

What is a problem?

Something painful, maybe? Something that grabs our attention unpleasantly? Something that you're unwilling to co-exist with in its current state of balance? Is a problem for someone else you're unaware of still a problem for you?

Let's define any balanced system as (XY). Perhaps these are the known/knowable parts of a [three-body linkage/engine](../17.md#three-body-linkages-engines). (XY) together are operating in balance. Either them by themselves is a "problem", i.e. a half in search of its other half, or an agent that's looking for its rhythm and is testing itself against any other agents it comes across. We'll call this a "problem", hehe.

Let's think about this from the observer's point of view.

The representation system I'm using below uses ABC (and in one spot B‚ÇÅ and B‚ÇÇ, where we need to distinguish between the two B areas), referencing Known, Knowable, and Unknown zones using the same outlined 2x2 grid we saw a minute ago. I'm simplifying the graph a little bit, to reduce clutter, but I'm anchoring with blue and pink as visual cues for how knowledge states sit here.

The dot in the center of the lower-left (aka Known aka center of the observer's awareness) square indicates the observer itself. ("Ourselves"?)

Anyway, let's move through these. Numbering these 8 charts as lines of language, left to right descending:

1. CXY
   1. X and Y are both hanging out in C, the Unknown
   2. X and Y can see each other, which means they get to operate in their shared rhythm.
   3. The observer is unaware of both X and Y.
   4. There is no problem.
2. BXCY
   1. X has advanced into B, the Knowable territory.
   2. Y remains in C, the Unknown.
   3. X and Y can see each other, which means they get to operate in their shared rhythm.
   4. The observer can only see X.
3. BXY
   1. Y has joined X in B, the Knowable territory.
   2. X and Y can see each other, which means they get to operate in their shared rhythm.
   3. The observer is aware of both X and Y.
   4. There is no problem.
4. AXBY
   1. X has moved into Known territory, which is the observer's center of awareness.
   2. Y remains in B, the Knowable territory.
   3. X and Y can see each other, which means they get to operate in their shared rhythm.
   4. The observer has up-close knowledge of X, but does not have up-close knowledge of Y.
   5. This is a problem if the observer doesn't trust that X (which it can see up close) and Y (which it can fuzzily see further back) can figure it out.
5. AXY
   1. X and Y have both moved into Known territory, which is the observer's center of awareness.
   2. X and Y can see each other, which means they get to operate in their shared rhythm.
   3. The observer has up-close knowledge of both X and Y.
   4. This is only a problem if the observer doesn't _like_ XY, lol.
6. AXCY
   1. Okay here we've jumped states a bit.
   2. X is in Known territory, which is the observer's center of awareness.
   3. Y remains in the Unknown.
   4. For the first time in our exploration here, _X and Y cannot see each other_.
      1. Now let's think about this for a second. Another way to define this scenario is that the observer is has fixed X in its awareness, _and has fixed the absence of Y in its awareness as well_.
   5. If the observer is willing to hang out with miracles, they stand a chance at seeing X operate in tandem with an invisible Y. If not, the observer has a problem.
7. BXCY
   1. We've seen this before, in diagram #2, but I've drawn it a second time here because the observer can conceive of _separate_ zones of Unknown, zones which cannot directly interact without passing through the Unknown (aka without dissolving beyond definition as a part of their transition).
   2. The idea here is that the observer has _shunted_ X from B‚ÇÅ to A and through to B‚ÇÇ, perhaps on its way back to C where it can rejoin Y beyond the observer's ability to observe. This is suggestive of a kind of respiration.
8. B‚ÇÅXB‚ÇÇY AKA GOD HELP YOU
   1. The observer sees X over in one Knowable zone, and Y over in _another, separate_ Knowable zone.
   2. The observer has a problem. ü§© What will they do?

Each grid maintains the same structure: black borders with midpoint gaps, dot in lower-left representing observer, and consistent color coding (blue=Known, pink=Unknown, stripes=Knowable). Starting with &#x27;CXY&#x27; where both X and Y are unknown (top-right), through various states of knowability, ending with &#x27;B‚ÇÅXB‚ÇÇY&#x27; where X and Y are in separate Knowable zones. Each diagram is labeled with its state (e.g., &#x27;AXBY&#x27;) and shows positions of X and Y relative to the observer&#x27;s perspective. The final diagram (#8) includes the subtitle &#x27;AKA GOD HELP YOU&#x27;, emphasizing the problematic nature of X and Y being visible but separated."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
