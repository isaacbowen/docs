# On this day, my eighth wedding anniversary

:)

It's more than ten years at this point.

:)

That's how I feel about that.

:)

It's been more than ten years at this point. Our wedding was eight years ago; the date still glows back there, a little further back now, like a sun breaking the horizon.

We broke the night first, of course, and I don't mean that in a _particular_ sexy way. We were with each other in dark places, and found that this was the company we wanted, for all of it, all stages of light.

I love you. I love you to the sun and back. :)

Eight years and ten years, as I'm turning 36 (December 16). This period of time feels like the completion of a few different preparatory cycles, like closing the loop on a few things, wrapping new rings on a few spirals at once.

I won't name what we're doing here. Not that it's a secret; it's that I don't want the meaning I build here to be tied to those specifics. But what we're doing here is _for_ ten years from now. We're already up there, looking back at us here. The lines are connected, and we are working together. Past, present, and future are all lifting each other higher. They didn't say it would be this much fun. :)

You're my best friend. Those are my favorite words for you. My best friend.

I can't always roll in sync with an Other. But when I can, you're the one I want to see first. :) Thank you for being you, and for being you _here_, together with me, in and through \*gestures\* all of this, on every level. I'm so glad it's you. :)
