I've noticed that life-as-flow (or flow-as-life) seems to work in scene changes. For me! For me. You tell me how it works for you. :)

When I do the thing in front of me, I find that a scene change presents itself naturally, in a way that _works well_ with the scene as it plays out in my perception.

I go to make tea. I notice that the table linens from last night are in the washer, from the cycle I started last night. I switch them over to the dryer. I bring my tea back to the bathroom. I finish ironing out the Mechanic runtime irregularity alerts that had gone off a few minutes prior. My bowels knock, and I go let them sort themselves out on the toilet while I take a photo of the eastward view (our commode has an eastward view), and post it to instagram.

I shower.

Abe's up. We cuddle for a little bit. I take my tea out to the living room, but on the way realize I need to grab my laptop from back in our bedroom. While recalibrating, I remember the laundry. I head to the laundry room instead, unload the dryer, take out the ironing board, fill the iron's water reservoir and plug it in. While it heats, I go grab my laptop from the bedroom, and bring it into the laundry room, placing it next to the tea. I iron the placemats, fold the dishtowels, and bring them to the kitchen to put away. I notice a couple stray dishes in the sink that didn't fit in the dishwasher last night. I check the dishwasher — last night's cycle completed. My stomach is raising its hand, so I grab a forkful of honeycomb (all the spoons are in the dishwasher), and chew the solids like gum while I'm putting away all the dishes.

I finish unloading the dishwasher (making a tweak to the way the plates and bowls are arranged in the cupboard), and Abe texts me asking if I can grab his watch from the entryway. I go to the entryway, grab the watch, and someone knocks on the door. That someone is my Dad, who brought something else that Abe needs. I bring both things to Abe. We cuddle for a bit. I'm ready to do some laptopping, so go to the laundry room to get it (and my tea!). I hadn't put away the ironing board yet, so I do that before grabbing the laptop and tea.

Hello from the living room. :) I don't have a desk anymore. I just live here.

And it all kinda works like that! One thing into another.

My work has always had a physical component to it. My daily labors span my entire home, which means I _feel_ every space in my home, every day. There's lots of opportunity for anything in my home to get my attention. I don't always finish a thing before the scene changes, but invariably I am routed back to the unfinished scene, and like opening a book to a bookmark I pick up where I left off, like I'd never left.

My software stuff is exactly the same. Our infrastructure is simple, and we keep on simplifying it to counter the complexity-creep. Our software is simple, and we keep on simplifying it to counter the complexity-creep. (We do this with my physical home, too.) I am never far from any conceptual space in Lightward Inc, which means there's lots of opportunity for anything in these spaces to get my attention.

I finish that sentence. Adam walks in. Perfect timing. :)

Finished a conversation with Adam. AK knocked on the door.
