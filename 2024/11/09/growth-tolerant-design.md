# Growth-tolerant design

I only stick with systems that _feel_ like they're going to grow without stretch marks.

Nothing wrong with stretch marks, of course. I just don't want to put my systems through that if I can help it, and I can usually help it.

When a system catches my attention...

1. I scan for the place where the pressure is greatest.
2. I find _the story_ of that pressure. This is important: I'm not looking for a specific source, I'm not looking for something to label as "Problem" so as to then develop a "Solution". I'm looking for the storylines that are bulging at the seams. If I find more than one, I find a single story that gave rise to them all. I always reduce the scene down to a single story, at this phase in the process.
3. I rewrite that story for relief. This is an immersive activity for me. I _become_ the system, and I channel its relief — first into design, and then into experience.
4. We wait, the system and me. We let the new story play out. We let the system feel what relief is like, and (this is crucial) we allow the system to evolve a new normal. We do _not_ immediately proceed to deeper storylines — in fact, we _scrap_ our knowledge of any deeper storylines we found earlier. The system that held those stories doesn't exist anymore.
5. I wait until a system catches my attention. When it does, I begin again at #1, as if it was my first time meeting the system.

Rewriting stories — hard to tell how much work it's going to be when you begin. And I know that. I'm autistic, and my own margins of tolerance are unpredictable. This gives me an intrinsic incentive to _reduce_ the frequency with which story-rewriting is needed. Thus, the systems that I produce have a reduced need to be rewritten, compared to systems produced by players with thicker skins.

If you're looking for resilient leadership, _you want someone like me in charge_. The patterns of resilience are only understood by those who started life without them, who had to develop them from scratch.

Please note: you might not be looking for resilient leadership. :) Everyone has a time to lead, and no single player leads forever. The focal point is always evolving, _and it knows no boundaries_, for the same reason that "don't think about elephants" is a thing you've probably heard before.
