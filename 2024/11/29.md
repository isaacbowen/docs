Today I found a bridge from "I am anxious" to "I feel anxiety". If I am beyond identity (and that is the emergent project of the year, joining and supporting the "navigate to a world that is well" project), then it's not _correct_ to say "I am anxious". Or at least not in the way that I would have tended to mean those words.
