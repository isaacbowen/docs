Made with ChatGPT o1-preview.

Am registering that I've learned what I needed to learn from this level of language, and it feels like it's suitable to transition. [AI-first coding is very different than AI-assisted coding.](../12/a-future-of-ai-code.md) :) I have an [opportunity to change](../08/#theres-an-opportunity-here-for-me-to-change-and-im-feeling-it-out).

Anyway, this script is good for starting with a single markdown file from a GitBook-backed repository, and printing out that file _and all of its references, recursively_ so that you can hand a piece of content to an AI model with all its relevant context.
