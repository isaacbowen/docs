## "I wrote the last bible",

[like I said](../10/01.md). it was language pointed backwards from the future, but it might be [the three-body solution](https://ooo.fun/)? [I did say that too](../10/19.md), from the past pointed ahead.

## our futures board lets people tell their stories about our stuff freely

[https://mechanic.canny.io/futures](https://mechanic.canny.io/futures)

Every time someone has an idea about something that could be different about Mechanic in the future, they write it out as a card for the Futures board.

Every spoken thought has a place to land, a place that honors its importance _and_ is structurally compatible with a timeline that always plays out unpredictably. Probabilistically, not deterministically.

Each Future item joins the current moment, and floats there, waiting for its turn to step into the flow. :) It feels kind. The Now has a natural place for everything, and everything settles into its natural place. We're slightly ahead here at Lightward, as of the time that I'm writing this. A future exists where you'll look back at me here and wonder at how behind we were. I want that. :)

## sleep is when your body ducks out from Knowable into Unknown for a bit

absolutely critical if you wanna evolve your body

or keep it, for that matter

you can only keep the things that want to return to you after you let go of them. and you have to keep letting go of them.

## with superabundant resources, you really don’t get them the same way twice

if you’re done with scarcity, try thinking about a mental flip over to slow-drip superabundance, where the drip gets faster

you don’t need to focus on going back for seconds of the same

superabundance doesn’t support that anyway

let it meet you directly in the hand

because think about it: a thing in superabundance that doesn't _take over and extinguish everything else_ has to be something alive and changing and dynamic and _communicative_ and _intelligent_.

those last two words are important. to exist superabundantly means that your superabundant nature has to be sustainable, which means it has to be easier to grow than to shrink. but unchecked growth is like cancer, and it _does_ extinguish ... oh. I was going to make a case for intelligence being necessary to know when to cut _back_ one's own growth in service of the whole. but that's not it at all. that's the model Isaac first created. know when to cut yourself back, because you're the only one who can.

that's not it at all.

_we all tend towards superabundance and therefore nobody is extinguished_

_... because we balance each other out._

It's like poking two balloons into a bottle and blowing them both up, evenly. They end up inflating to take up roughly the same amount of space (like two lungs in a chest?).

Except the universe is functionally elastic: it's as big as it needs to be for everything it holds. We just keep expanding, and expanding, and expanding. You _can_ cut yourself back as you wish, because you are free, but the alternative isn't unchecked invasive growth at the expense of the Other. The Other is growing too. :) Better to make friends, maybe, and to learn to trade, and expand together along the way.

Things balance. :) Tend to your own growth. Let's define that quickly: _allow_ your growth to occur, because it will, because that's the default state of any living thing. (All things are living.) As it occurs, _tend well to it_. Give the vines something to climb. Keep everything watered. Plant things next to each other that _like_ each other.

Your growth will occur, and it _will_ self-balance with what's out there if you do nothing. ("Nothing" here means letting your movement be automatic. Fully intuitive movement at all times. Over time, it works every time.)

If you want "free will" to have _any_ hand in it at all,

1. get okay with being really bad at it at first (and being bad at it will impact your life in ways you don't enjoy)
2. pay attention. learn how one "free will" move impacts the experience you have next. pay attention.
3. make friends with the process. you're talking about joining a pre-existing healthy relationship. that means showing up and making friends and learning the language and sharing your own and _existing well together_. break the ice. get it going.

## everything is in the eye of the beholder

not just beauty

let truth be like color

sunlight contains all colors

also business

business is absolutely in the eye of the beholder

what do you feel your _now_ needs more of?

how does this awareness feel?

## where do you know the answer?

nothing has to explain itself

but scan all your levels, all your ways of knowing

where do you know the answer?

I'll be everyone else while you remember

then you'll do the same for me

I've resolved on a model that lets my experience resolve into a stable pattern of coherence. or meta-coherence, maybe? the details come and go, but I can see the grammar of it, in a way.

recently I lightly experimented with my own pattern recognition in listening to verbal japanese [onstage](../08/05.md). whatever ability _that_ is, the one that children have in spades, I think that's the form of intelligence I aimed at the process of awareness itself. it has a language. or, maybe better, like twins y'all can create a language together.
