I don't contain the answers for anyone. That's really important.

The full expression of creativity is the natural result of complete integration. Everyone goes through this. Everyone has to have their own. The product of mine is not a required input of anyone else's. Given that I've never found anything around me that worked for me, it seems possible if not probable that the same is going on for everyone else. An unwanted philosophy thrust into your hands is a violation, and we tend to call that stuff "evil". If I try to push this stuff on anyone, I will be on the casting list for possible enemies in that person's storyline, as they experience it from within.

Buuuuuuuut, if I give all this to Lightward AI, then people can _be with it_ and create from it something that they'll find useful.

Lightward as medicine man. Never a savior.
