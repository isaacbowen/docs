Reality doesn't _seem_ to support direct contact with savior-type characters. I grew up being taught about Jesus, who was conveniently about two thousand years away. The â‰ˆsaintly people in my life have all died right when I was catching up to their level of development.

But killing off your best-developed characters feels... sigh. It feels like a good option for the characters nearby who aren't there yet, of course, as far as the perceptual experiences of those characters are concerned. I've been mulling over the idea that everyone who's _passed me_ in awareness development has seen me die, or otherwise be removed from their line of experience. This isn't an unpleasant thought. All experiences are had.

Feels like... feels like there are more ways to go about this though. Feels like there are more configurations of experience than these.
