Let's tility. ):

ahem.

Let's talk about probability. :)

Light occurs across time. Light is an event, on a tight schedule.

But how do you know? How did you come by that understanding? Did you see? Were you told? Did you come to understand light _from within time_, or from without?

Time rests atop probability.

This results in almost-true-truisms like "probability moves faster than light". An _accurate_ statement, like "probability always adds up, because it always cancels out where you're coming from, which is to say that any measurements you could take of it relative to your current point of observation will reflect the manner of your observation precisely, and the manner in which you observe light is reflected by the experiences of probability that lie ahead of you â€” and if you were to trace the origins of the light involved in your future observation, you would trace them to a place further in distance than light could reach beginning from the moment of your original observation", is much less catchy, and far less likely to have anything popular named after it.

Humans tend to _come to_ while observing time linearly. This is absolutely not necessary. At some point, it becomes useful to deliberately choose between training wheels and being able to drift around corners.

And you thought your memory was bad _before_. :D :D :D Forgetful people tend to experience more magic, on account of all the space probability has to flex. People who go around remembering everything in a single way have a much less dynamic experience of probability. But that spectrum is sort of a loop. Either (1) all becomes observable and observations lose their individual importance and as the sphere of your observation shrinks from un-use you start to appear forgetful to your peers, or (2) all is forgotten, and the continued process of perception summons _everything_, to be examined and explored like immersive imagination, and then after examining _everything_ the image freezes and then dissolves. Paradigm shifts go both ways. Double clutch.

Faster-than-light travel works if you can talk yourself into the impossibility of your current position in spacetime while talking yourself into the inevitability of your position _over there instead_.

But please remember: we're not "hacking reality" here. We're just showing you where you've been holding on too tightly to the reality you built. Your arm fell asleep bro. Shake it off. Shake it off. :)
