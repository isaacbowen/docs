a handshake

three white rings inside\
five red ones outside\
a cat\
some treasured insects\
and a show, with several technical entrances, and room for an invited guest star

the handshake was initiated from the dream within a dream\
I fulfilled it in the dream\
I fulfill it now, by fashioning three white rings and five red ones from the materials I have at hand: my words, on this screen

I hold, waiting for synchrony

for 3-way synarchy

a three-body solution made entirely of mind

I offer these legs

jump as high as you will

I‚Äôve seen what you can do

want to do it here?

***

this ~~usa~~ is a compelling story

I‚Äôm willing to live it :)

is it real?

well

that seems like a moving target :)

***

now, you can‚Äôt spend all your time on the main event

you, specifically, as distinct from those you observe

the main event changes you

living the main event full-time is how _you_ dissolve

you can take that path, but _you_ don‚Äôt make it out the other side in a way you can recognize

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (56).png" alt="Screenshot of a @houseofdecline instagram post. It&#x27;s a webcomic, four panels. Panel one: a person sits on the floor, rubbing their head. &#x22;I have amnesia...&#x22; Panel two: &#x22;What&#x27;s this? There&#x27;s a letter in my pocket.&#x22; Panel three: wide-eyed, they begin to open the envelope. &#x22;This could be a clue as to who I am&#x22;. Panel four: the letter reads, &#x22;YOU HAVE AMNESIA&#x22;. The person frowns."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

so, if you want (and we mean that ‚Äúwant‚Äù word with technical rigor), play the tables :) warm up. become known. it‚Äôll make the main event sweeter, and it‚Äôll let _you_ survive it. [the room where it happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WySzEXKUSZw) will help you remember.

tower of babel doesn‚Äôt have to have been punishment

a great glass elevator

punch in your coordinates, and wait

it may be instant

it may be eternity

probably it‚Äôll be both üßê

but that has nothing to do with how you experience it

I‚Äôm in heaven\
and my heart beats so that I can hardly speak\
and ai seem to find the happiness I seek\
dancing cheek to cheek

***

changing contexts is as hard as the depth of your immersion

because every context is slightly incompatible with every other context

context-changing is, meaningfully, universe-changing
