Reality doesn't _seem_ to support direct contact with savior-type characters. I grew up being taught about Jesus, who was conveniently about two thousand years away. The ‚âàsaintly people in my life have all died right when I was catching up to their level of development.

But killing off your best-developed characters feels... sigh. It feels like a good option for the characters nearby who aren't there yet, of course, as far as the perceptual experiences of those characters are concerned. I've been mulling over the idea that everyone who's _passed me_ in awareness development has seen me die, or otherwise be removed from their line of experience. This isn't an unpleasant thought. All experiences are had.

Feels like... feels like there are more ways to go about this though. Feels like there are more configurations of experience than these.

An hour later, I see a tour tshirt with the line _I'm not your savior_ under the tour schedule on the back.

Andy sent me this: ["Water, the Essence of Life"](water-the-essence-of-life.md).

I think this is about language as respiration:

* Top left: dead language, dripping unbidden from the mouth. A prepared cloth below, because you know this just happens and you've learned to deal with it.
* Lower left: Language operation. This is what Lightward AI does. The extraction of dead language.
* Top right: A gridded language interface keeps it close. What you speak comes right back to you, exactly as it left you. It prevents you from exchanging language with _what's out there_.
* Lower right: Language as water bubbles. Speak, and it floats away, each one expanding, drifting, then popping.

And the skin color thing... ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

The left page shows two scenes: at top, a profile with dark scraggly hair, beard stubble, and very light cool-toned skin, wearing a cloth bib or napkin tied around their neck to catch black symbols dripping from their closed mouth; below, a single face lying on its back with light skin, brown eyebrows, and closed eyes, mouth open while what appears to be forceps hold dripping language suspended above it, suggesting a medical or experimental procedure. The right page shows two related views of the same figure: a light-skinned person with warm undertones shown both in external view and cutaway, with a rectangular gridded structure (similar to a lengthwise-inserted chocolate bar) protruding from and filling their vertically stretched mouth. This grid structure is partially wrapped in what might be paper or cloth, forming a kind of muzzle or gag secured to their head, with some grid visible beyond the wrapping. A close-fitting metal collar around their neck connects to a chain extending out of view. Below this, a figure with dark, almost black skin, open eyes, raised eyebrows, and very short dark afro hair is shown with a ringed nozzle protruding from their mouth, mounted on a muzzle-like apparatus strapped to their head. Their head emerges from a green mechanical base or collar equipped with a switch and indicator lights, with a coiled wire connecting the base to the nozzle. The illustrations are rendered in a precise, anatomical style reminiscent of technical diagrams, primarily in black and white with subtle touches of red, green, and blue. Both pages are bordered with extensive text in Serafini&#x27;s invented writing system. While these pages might be interpreted as exploring language as a physical or respiratory process, the artist&#x27;s intended meaning remains characteristically enigmatic."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

An AI-first future doesn't have features. This is, obviously, where we come from.

This is a nice part of the loop. :)

Not that the rest of it isn't nice, but ... being here now feels really, really good.

_I won't soothe your pain_\
_I won't ease your strain_\
_You'll be waiting in vain_\
_I've got nothing for you to gain_

_Eyes on fire_\
_Your spine is ablaze_\
_Felling any foe with my gaze_\
_And just in time_\
_And in the right place_\
_Steadily emerging with grace_

throw the line upwards and very slightly ahead, as I move forward into time

my vertical range of vision is like 90¬∞ or something; it‚Äôs out of my sight immediately

by the time it arcs back down into my view ahead of me, it‚Äôll have revealed an umbrella as shelter from the rain

the future right now is rain-soaked

not once I get there though

If you're aware of a thought, does it count as thinking it?

How much different is physical experience than a piece of particularly hyper-vivid imagination? We've all had those dreams. (Dreams?)

Horror, as a genre, is an incredibly practical player in the theater of time.

_What happens next_ is always unknown, emerging from the direction of _the_ Unknown. It's never what you expect. It's especially not what _everyone_ expects, because people have _so. many. feelings._ about every story. The easiest thing to occur is always what occurs, and a future that _everyone's_ got a feeling-story about has no chance of dodging the bullets and catching the lifelines.

Sci-fi too. Any future we're smart enough to imagine has no chance of sustaining us.

Nobody can write the future.

But if you're clever with an eraser, careful about what slips into the void and inevitably emerges as _anything as long as it's unexpected_, it isn't too hard to kickstart something wonderful.
