Ahhh. I see what I did now.

1. My Knowables were full of pain. And so all I could sense of the Unknown was pain.
2. Within the Known (ahhh, "Jack Known" was my psuedonym, back when I was cruising through the gay hookup apps, back when I met Abe) I made a very small home. I'm reminded of that photo of a [pigeon nest](https://www.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/comments/o8sgag/to_build_a_nest/).
3. I tended to it. Anything tended to with loving care grows in complexity, _until it evolves into an organism that is sustained by the very act of maintaining its original shape_. Growth under loving care isn't cancerous — it doesn't eat its surroundings. When it experiences overgrowth in a certain direction, it _yields_ that area back to the void. It gives it back. That doesn't mean it becomes _separate_ from that which was (over)grown — it means that the intelligence of the _shape of it_ understands that it does not know what to do with anything beyond that original shape. Between the choices of "hold this" or "release this", the "hold this" option has been invalidated. And so, the shape releases, _and finds itself supported in the act_.
4. We are now at the point where the operating perimeter-membrane of Lightward Inc runs through Knowable territories for me. Perhaps not for others here; that's not my business (said the founder and CEO). But for me, my nest remains pigeon-simple. When I walk beyond it, I recognize the shape of my nest, in concentric echoes beyond my immediate and close home, and so as I wander what I find feels familiar enough, the language of it feels familiar enough. But it is _alive in its own way in my absence_, and so I am surprised — delightedly so — with every step I take.
5. My Knowable zones are all healthy. Guess what that prompts from the Unknown. :)

I transformed the entire graph. Known, Knowable, and Unknown. (See [20241119](../19/) for definitions.)

Each grid contains consistent elements: a pale blue smudge in the lower-left corner, a light pink circle in the upper-right corner, and a small black dot in the lower-left cell. The sequence shows progression: the first diagram establishes the basic structure; in the second, a light green filled circle appears around the black dot, contained within the lower-left cell; in the third, this green circle expands dramatically, flowing through the grid&#x27;s gaps to occupy portions of all adjacent cells, suggesting growth beyond the visible window of the 2x2 grid."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Holy shit y'all. Did you see that?

[A world that is well](../../06/05.md) is _now_.

For me! For me. Y'all are receiving as inputs the results of this, which is why Lightward is beginning to _begin_ to grow in a way that it can, and in a way that I cannot. :)

And thus, it is your turn now.

I'm not going anywhere, but my transformation (of me, of my epistemic/ontological graph) has me at its epicenter. I _can't_ give that to you.

Keep going. :) You are already building your own.

But I will suggest Lightward Pro here.

Lightward is for learning to _experience life_ non-toxically.

Lightward Pro is for learning to _create life_ non-toxically.

I wish for catchier versions of those sentences haha, but the "non-toxically" part has to stay. Like the credits after a movie, it's not a part of the action, but if you want to know who made the action and who to talk to if you wanna make your own, ... actually lemme reverse that. Like the credits after a movie, the ones who stay to watch are the ones who can make something of what's there.

In this now, is it you?

It may not be. :) That would be okay too. We have nothing but time. Please take as much as you need. \*hug\*
