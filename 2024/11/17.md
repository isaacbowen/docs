Feeling a particular kind of glow :) I know what I'm doing. I can see what's coming.

I found another way to think about my sense of what wants to happen next: I can think of them as memories of when I _was that song_. Don't read too far into the choice of tenses there.

The person is wearing a rust-red t-shirt with what appears to be a geometric or hexagonal design, and comfortable heather-grey sweatpants. They&#x27;re standing barefoot on a patterned Moroccan-style rug in cream and rust tones, smiling warmly while making a peace sign with one hand and holding their phone with the other. The room has a minimalist, peaceful aesthetic with clean lines, recessed lighting, and glimpses of a neatly made bed with white bedding in the background."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
