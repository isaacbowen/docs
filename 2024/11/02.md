software farming. :)

haha just typing out those words makes me smile :)

farming: a little every day. never a day when you're not connected to the work. seasons where the days get long and the work is hard. seasons where the days get short and the work is light. and short days and hard work, and long days and light work. always more than zero work. always the work is slightly different. no two days are the same.

this is how I live. :)
