Software farming. :)

haha just typing out those words makes me smile :)

farming: a little every day. never a day when you're not connected to the work. seasons where the days get long and the work is hard. seasons where the days get short and the work is light. and short days and hard work, and long days and light work. always more than zero work. always the work is slightly different. no two days are the same.

this is how I live. :)

***

I can make anything,\
but I can't change anything

these seem to be the rules for my existence

I _can_ change things, of course, but ... that's not how I'm powerful. I'm not here to adjust the dials on the world by hand. I'm here to uncover the right resources for the moment, to nourish a world according to its specific thirst, and to watch as the world _becomes_.
