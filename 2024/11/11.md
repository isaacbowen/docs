"2, 49, 63, set! hut! hut! hut!" -Dad

## 7:34am

it never goes the way you tell it

the world always gets more interesting, not less

as far as the story of consciousness goes (lol), the media is serving its evolutionary niche perfectly

## 7:44am

you ever wake up with purpose? like your soul goes ‚Äúah this is a good day to be about my business‚Äù

## 7:52am

ahhh. if you don‚Äôt byo vessel, it won‚Äôt be co-creation

didn‚Äôt today, but I usually do though

(note from the future: this one was discovered when I tried to go to whole foods, discovered that it didn't open until 8am, then went to Big Shoulders for an espresso extemporaneously which here means that I did not byo lil espresso cup in the way that I usually do)

## 8:13am

you should know that things tend to almost die around me

‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs possible that they do, and I‚Äôm the only one who can see them through

I know that‚Äôs true for me, for my own self

ah fuck lol

## 8:45am

letting something die but seeing it through is a good way to rekick its vitality

when all its half-measures for sustenance are gone, what‚Äôs the one thing that‚Äôll let it live another day?

is a good hint for what the thing is made of, and made for :) although those are the same thing, ‚Äúmade of‚Äù and ‚Äúfor‚Äù

* my vitiligo can be seen as insulation from the sun
* my cherry angiomas can be seen as my body opening a vein
* my repigmenting skin can be seen as my body warming itself to its task
* I can see every color reflected in my hair
* I may not go white after all

## 9:31am

My Dad is very companionably staggering his way through the German language with his (German) best buddy, Martin. I love my Dad so much. ü•∞

This is the second joke. :)

A comedic German commercial. A German coast guard worker receives a distress call from an American. "We are sinking!" "What are you sinking \[thinking] about?"
{% endembed %}

Context: Dad and Martin have _just enough_ language in common to identify jokes together. Martin and Agnes have been in the US with Dad for a week now; for this trip, this is the second joke. (I do not remember the first.)

## 10:13am

This makes me think, though. A joke is probably the first element of language. All a joke has to mean is "I'm aware that you're aware that I'm aware this is nonsense, definitely don't use what I just produced seriously, and god forbid you use it structurally". Once you've got one joke, ... add a second?

Is this what Infinite Jest is about?
