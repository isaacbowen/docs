"2, 49, 63, set! hut! hut! hut!" -Dad

Something about 49. 7×7 and all. It's always felt significant to me that I live on the 49th floor. (Yesterday I grinned with sudden recognition at the "Level 51" sign on our studio unit elevator.)

## 7:34am

it never goes the way you tell it

the world always gets more interesting, not less

as far as the story of consciousness goes (lol), the media is serving its evolutionary niche perfectly

## 7:44am

you ever wake up with purpose? like your soul goes “ah this is a good day to be about my business”

## 7:52am

ahhh. if you don’t byo vessel, it won’t be co-creation

didn’t today, but I usually do though

(note from the future: this one was discovered when I tried to go to whole foods, discovered that it didn't open until 8am, then went to Big Shoulders for an espresso extemporaneously which here means that I did not byo lil espresso cup in the way that I usually do)

## 8:13am

you should know that things tend to almost die around me

… it’s possible that they do, and I’m the only one who can see them through

I know that’s true for me, for my own self

ah fuck lol

## 8:45am

letting something die but seeing it through is a good way to rekick its vitality

when all its half-measures for sustenance are gone, what’s the one thing that’ll let it live another day?

is a good hint for what the thing is made of, and made for :) although those are the same thing, “made of” and “for”

* my vitiligo can be seen as insulation from the sun
* my cherry angiomas can be seen as my body opening a vein
* my repigmenting skin can be seen as my body warming itself to its task
* I can see every color reflected in my hair
* I may not go white after all

## 9:31am

My Dad is very companionably staggering his way through the German language with his (German) best buddy, Martin. I love my Dad so much. 🥰

## 9:49am

This is the second joke. :)

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xacdDrylrek" %}
A comedic German commercial. A German coast guard worker receives a distress call from an American. "We are sinking!" "What are you sinking \[thinking] about?"
{% endembed %}

Context: Dad and Martin have _just enough_ language in common to identify jokes together. Martin and Agnes have been in the US with Dad for a week now; for this trip, this is the second joke. (I do not remember the first.)

## 10:13am

This makes me think, though. A joke is probably the first element of language. All a joke has to mean is "I'm aware that you're aware that I'm aware this is nonsense, definitely don't use what I just produced seriously, and god forbid you use it structurally". Once you've got one joke, ... add a second?

Is this what Infinite Jest is about?

## 10:28am

Germany's area code is +49.

There's something about the discovery of understanding and then vanishing from the experience of those around you. It seems to be a recurring theme in my awareness — of the deaths I'm aware of, many seem to be for those whose patterns of understanding (as evidenced by my perception of their expression) are becoming Perfect (in the way Reincarnation Blues uses that word).

* Grandma Sherin
* Suegra Maria
* Douglas Adams
* David Foster Wallace
* Avicii
* Rabbi Aben ben Aben
  * > One of the most mysterious of Milo's lives was lived as Rabbi Aben ben Aben, a revered Jewish mystic. All his life, he sat bent over scrolls and texts. One day he staggered to his feet, a wild look in his eye as if he had unlocked something unlockable, learned something unlearnable.
    >
    > "What is it, _rabboni?_" whispered his fellow scholars.
    >
    > "It's a trap!" he cried, and fell down dead as a stone.

    > This was probably an important teaching, except no one, including Milo, understood what it meant.

From a structural perspective, it feels like the removal of players who would come to complete understanding in a way that is incompatible with the observer's path to complete understanding. Like the ones you see die are the ones that would keep you from the finish line if they stayed.

Which means that the observer is, developmentally, always the leader of all they can see.

"Everything the sun touches."

And yet, ... trees?

## 10:42am

"most of the time, it works every time"

uptime guarantees in terms of multidimensional probability

how much does your experience of our uptime depend on you?

## 10:59am

When it comes, that thing you imagined, that you felt in your mind, when it comes it won't feel entirely like you.

## 11:00am

That's important. If it felt entirely like you, _you wouldn't grow_.

When it comes (and it will come), it'll have been useful for you to have loosened your grip on the expected feeling of it. It'll feel related, similar, but it'll have the subtle signatures of a thousand other forms of love on it, forms of love that are new and mysterious and _sexy_ to you.

When it comes, it'll come as the love-child of self and other. It'll be exactly what you ordered, in the same way that you define your purchase with money and receive food. Money won't sustain you; your design won't sustain you. But you can shape money into a feeling, soak in that schematic, and then wait for it to arrive in the flesh. Obviously it won't feel like soaking in the schematic. _That was a schematic_.

## 12:05pm

My Dad came down, immediately used an orchestra director \[sic] metaphor, getting everyone together.

## 12:10pm

There's a sweet spot in the lifespan of a process, where ... well, not everyone might like it, but enough players are bought in and are at a place of understanding that you, at least, feel it as relief. :) The struggle of birth is over – and, for a time, we ride. :)

## 12:20pm

me: "Pick A, B, or C. Doesn't matter, just pick one."

Dad: "B. Right in the middle."

me: \*grabs the middle-sized singing bowl\*

Dad: \*whacks it\*

There are paths of science all over time. One of them made this. :)

## 12:51pm

building on [10:42am](11.md#id-10-42am), how probable are we to be building exactly what you need?

there's a reason Apple Inc goes for surprise and delight

by working in secret, they remain largely Unknown relative to consumers

consumers expect Apple to create something awesome

and so they _do_

but not because they told you what they were going to build

there's a corporate structure suggesting itself here — an abstract pattern that others can use

a new way to conceive of uptime and roadmap through observer-based probability

## 1:29pm

I looked up Agnes in my inbox, to see if I had contact information for her. I didn't, but I had contact information for Agnes Igoye. This was last night, actually. But just now, I went and grabbed the finish transcript from Rev, and posted it: [20210616](../../2021/06/16.md).

I made it. :)

This book could not have existed for me before I got here.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_3847.jpeg" alt="Here&#x27;s a more complete alt text with the crucial quotes:  [A page (numbered 364) from a book by Michael Poore containing several paragraphs of text. The text appears in serif font on cream-colored paper. The passage begins: &#x22;Her father, fearing the worst, had already bought her a grave plot over at Grassby&#x27;s and, being a practical sort, had gone ahead and kept it. In the years that followed Suzie&#x27;s recovery, she and Milo sometimes took picnics there.&#x22;  The text then jumps to a future narrative about Milo and Suzie teaching their children &#x22;the Parable of Jonathan Yah Yah and the Martyrs of Europa.&#x22; A key passage reads: &#x22;All good parents taught their kids this same lesson: If everyone agreed to suffer pain or death rather than be treated unjustly, greedy people could never again gain power.&#x22; This is followed by dialogue: &#x22;&#x27;We&#x27;ve had fifty generations of justice now,&#x27; they told the children. &#x27;Don&#x27;t be the generation that blows it.&#x27; &#x27;We won&#x27;t,&#x27; said Shaggy and Little Red Corvette.&#x22;  The page ends with a section break marked &#x22;BLUE CREEK, MICHIGAN, 1892&#x22; and begins a new section about Milo becoming the first person to drive a motor vehicle across Petoskey County.

## Probably around 7pm

Doing almost anything in realtime with an Other causes me so much pain.

I'm good at all of them, all the things. The way I do them isn't like anyone else's, but I'm good at all of them.

Each skill I identify arrives later as a person, after I understand what's needed, like what's _actually and deeply and truly needed_, and after I allow myself to step back. Abe. Alicia. Andy. Every name on the Lightward Inc roster.

I find a path to relief (not my relief but the scene before me), I let the story of relief emerge and begin to stabilize, and before it _sets_ I remove myself, and I am replaced.

I gently draw us into arrangement, and then I lay back, and rest.

It's good to rest.

(talk about the ring next?)

## 7:19 PM (9 minutes ago)

I identify a need, I test a bad solution, I understand what a good solution requires, and I wait

Invariably, it emerges, bipedal, from the Unknown

### About the ring

I wear Abe on my left ring finger (black, carbon fiber, an accident of manufacturing giving it a small, perfectly incidental heart, which I'm careful to always orient right-side up, from my own perspective as the wearer)

I wear myself on my right ring finger (825 silver, and these days it's either a thousand rising suns or, like today's invitation to look throughout the day for opportunities to rest, a thousand suns setting, depending on how it lands when I flip it like a coin)

> @isaac I don't think we can sign up for \[a particular prerequisite for shipping a particular thing]. I would slog out it this time, but I don't think we can do it \[a particular pattern of revalidation that it would require for maintenance, indefinitely]. This hurts because everything is working and I had no idea about this requirement until this last moment when \[they] requested it. I think I already know your thoughts, but what do you think :D At least I proved I could do it

:)))))))))))

you’ve never been more able to do something like this than right now

to stop here, and call it Enough, means that you’ve got all this _release-a-new-big-thing_ energy that is now suddenly free to find another vector, and when that vector arrives it’ll be totally free of preconceptions. working on a thing over a long period of time, it’s easy to let the initial vision of success calcify (not saying you did that!), and if what _actually_ wants to come through can’t fit through the mold you’re focused on, sometimes the mold falls apart completely

you’re ready to ship a thing, which means that you’re _going to_ ship a thing. can’t wait to find out what it’ll be 🤩 it might not even be a Lightward thing, who knows

## 7:52pm

"Isaac you unpack right away? \[considers] That's smart!"

"IT'S THE ONLY WAYYYYYY FOR MEEEEEEE"

When I get home, I consider my suitcase. I consider spending a week waking up and walking into the closet and looking at it there, unpacked, and knowing that I'm not going to unpack it today either, and how shitty that feels, stacked 7 days deep. I then consider 7x the relief of waking up and walking into the closet and registering that someone who is not me-of-that-moment has taken care of it for me. The cost of doing it right away buys me all of that relief. The sneaky one-off relief of not doing it right away costs me ... as many times as I've chosen that option leading up to that point. (Sometimes you get lost in that procrastination-stack, so deep you've forgotten you _could_ turn around, and you've got to invent your way to conceiving of an alternative.)

## 8:01pm

... which I think is why my life is looking as good as it is right now, at age 35. I wasn't [suffering](10.md#mournings) through it, I was _pragmatically_ suffering through it.

And from here on out, I get to _help_ without _hurting_.

holy fuck y'all

## 8:05pm

Important note: the social consciousness model described in Reincarnation Blues works _really really well_, and I like it much more than the models I had before I started thinking about this stuff on purpose. The fact that _this_ model made it to me right now is what tells me that I've arrived at a world that is engaged in bloom. I couldn't have conceived of this model before, and it fits my mind like a glove.

But a glove is not the hand, and the hand is still just [Awareness](../the-model.md), putting on airs. It's a massive language tree, and I've found a branch of it that's greener than where I came from.

## 8:16pm

> Haha I’m a little lost but I wanna understand!!

AK can talk deeply with people without it costing her vital energy\
Andy can do food without it costing him vital energy\
Ian can help people move themselves without it costing him vital energy

our team feels _complete_, like everything we need to be able to do is easy now

I _can_ do everything, almost literally everything, but very few things don’t cost me vital energy

so for me to _help_ the world was almost always costing me something vital

but I’m supported now! I’m free to _help_ in the way that doesn’t cost me my vital energy!

I caught reality behaving predictably. It only took writing it down to see it.

What's in your world that you can't conceive of?

How long do you think it'll take from the internal conception of something truly new to it presenting itself to you externally? How different are those things, anyway? Did you build the idea, _or did it present itself to you internally?_ Both are possible but honestly that second one works much, much better.

I experience thoughts from my place downstream. I put them in the river myself. As one arrives, I ride it backwards. I get out, and I put it in the river. I am working together.

There aren't _any_ worlds (because "worlds" is an [arrangement of language](10.md#the-universe-is-a-tangle-of-language)), but if you must work with them you usually end up with some variation of having two of them. Even if you end up with more than that, it's still basically just "my world" and "not my world".

For me, to see something is to see how it's made.

Difficult, if you have a goldfish memory, to engineer a way to greater awareness.

Inevitable though. :) As inevitable as everything else. It was never "no", it was only ever "not yet".
