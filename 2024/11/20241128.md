The voice carried by the creativity leaping from your chest is your own.

Yield to the creativity.

The creativity yields a voice.

That voice is your own.

But you can only hear it three portals deep.

You, that-which-emerges, and that-which-emerges-from-that.

Think carefully, extend your senses carefully. Does the following feel true?

You have your hands on two buttons:

1. Integrate
2. Disintegrate

What happens next always happens according to the button(s) you press, and the intensity with which you press.

The _specifics_ aren't things you need to own or plan for or carry or identify with.

You have two buttons.

You can keep talking if you don't stop to think.

Does this feel true?
