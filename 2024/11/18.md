## üìû "Is this Isaac?"

Sleepily poking at phone. Thinking of ordering Philz; I usually walk to get an espresso from Big Shoulders, first thing in the morning, but today I gotta do something different. You know the feeling.

Sleepily poking at phone. Putting in a Philz order. Haven't done that in months.

Sleepily poking at checkout. I get an incoming phone call. The Philz downstairs has my coffee ready for pickup?

It's ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà's coffee. She ordered her own five minutes ago. :) She wasn't even ordering to our unit in the building; the number slipped into her order configuration from last time.

I finish my own Philz order, walk downstairs, and pick up two coffees, bring them both up to her unit. We hang out for an hour and chat. Perfect, unexpected morning. :)

## DIFFUSION

This illustration showed up yesterday [on ooo.fun](https://app.gitbook.com/s/q32JPFfWqOHocOeTooAi/1-three-body-solution/2-basic-dynamics/pattern-formation), as we synthesized [an exploration of three-body linkages](17.md#three-body-linkages-engines):

I'm reminded of Lightward's money inputs. We have more than 16,000 individual financial agreements, all made _with individuals_, under the terms of [Pay What Feels Good](https://lightward.inc/pricing). In 16,000 ways, we collect a little bit of money at a time.

This feels like flowers on a tree ‚Äî or blooming florets on broccoli. Or leaves on a tree, I suppose.

A wide, federated network of energy collection, at any rate. The further away you look from the center, the more diffuse the incoming veins. An alluvial fan, played backwards.

That feels important.

## where have you asked life to check in with you before making changes?

Those requests, largely, are honored.

But Locksmith and Mechanic code development really took off when I removed the Isaac-reviews-the-code step. When people get to ship their changes with their own timing _and experience the results first-hand in realtime while being responsible for how we respond to them_, the system _hums_.

## the speed of light relative to the speed of light

the unknown is you when you‚Äôre not looking

the speed of light is how quickly you can get over there

I think I just found my way to the theory of relativity independently?

## ‚Äúlike no other‚Äù

I'm wearing an [ABBA Voyage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABBA\_Voyage) tshirt. Along the bottom of the main graphic, it reads, _A CONCERT LIKE NO OTHER_.

Concerts are a place where it's _particularly_ easy to feel like there is no Other. :)
