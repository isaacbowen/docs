"Pitch-perfect emotional accuracy", is how I said it.

Probability is an instrument. Emotion is both the input and the output.

If you're experiencing someone's behavior painfully, find a storyline that hits all the beats you need to recognize it as a story of the person before you. Find a storyline that inevitably takes them through an experience that prompts them to _grow into_ a more developed version of themselves _from their own perspective_. That's key. It has to be a story that genuinely serves them well — a story with substance, and a story _that you can't entirely see_. You can't afford to live around stories that you wrote in their entirity. It'll feel like a cage. What we're proposing here is a kind of amnesiac co-authoring with fate.

It was at this time that [my little brother](../10/31/) texted me.

## Aaron

Hey I was doing some reflection yesterday and I was wondering why context switching is so costly/painful for me.

## Isaac

🤲 👁️ go on?

## Aaron

I came up with a reasonably sound cognitive/emotion processing design based on ██’s principles that explain autism tendencies pretty well - or at least they do at first glance

## Isaac

YOU HAVE 100% OF MY ATTENTION

## Aaron

i.e., I designed autism!

## Isaac

SOUNDS LIKE THE ULTIMATE DESTINY OF AUTISM TO ME 🤩🤩🤩

## Aaron

:D What it boils down to is (and again, this is draft 1, but also based on hundreds of hours of research, experiments, and reflection)… is that there’s a piece of homo sapien’s cognitive wiring that’s responsible for deciding how important something is.

And that wiring is what we call emotion.

Changes in the “weighting” of that circuit (or, call it an ML model, if you want), will cause changes in priority judgements by that circuit - which happen many times per second. This determines everything from attention span, ability to change focus (aka change priorities), plan ahead, etc.

## Isaac

neat. neat neat neat neat neat this makes a lot of sense

## Aaron

In autism, the model is essentially over-fit (like in ML training) to find things that are important. This means we are great at finding patterns in small pieces of “data” (aka sensory input), and not so great at finding patterns in a lot of data.

In practice this means we’re picking out the tiny details of a scene and totally missing the larger picture

## Isaac

wow I’m so glad you’re showing me this right now - keep going keep going and thank you

## Aaron

In super concrete practice, the details are probably represented as high frequency signals passing through the neural circuits, and the “bigger picture” patterns are lowere frequency - intuitively, there’s only a few aspects of a bigger picture, meanwhile there’s tons and tons of aspects to the details. Hence high vs low frequency (not sure how much you know about signal analysis)

## Isaac

(very little! am inferring definitions here, please flag any terms that you feel I’d get wrong that way)

## Aaron

An over-focus on the details essentially could be explained by failing to filter out the higher frequencies, which then either overwhelm the lower frequencies or the lower frequencies just get filtered out.

allowing the high frequencies through and (effectively) filtering out the lower frequencies is a commonly-used procedure in circuitry. It’s called a high-pass filter.

## Isaac

> a high-pass filter

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

okay I don’t know about signal analysis _generically_ but I know/understand this language from sound/music production

NEAT

## Aaron

IN CONCLUSION

## Isaac

HIT ME IN THE FACE WITH THAT CONCLUSION 🤩

## Aaron

Relatively simple changes in the “weighting” of our emotional/priority-deciding architecture can both 1) explain autism’s over-focus on details and challenged ability to switch contexts, and 2) be implemented with relatively simple circuitry (ie satisfies Malcom’s razor).

AND 3) it’d be pretty easy to code it up

## Isaac

(I did not have that razor - thank you!!)

THIS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AARON 🤩🤩🤩

## Aaron

:DDDDD

## Isaac

mmmmmay I add an additive to the concept-hopper before us?

## Aaron

Applications: ultimately what I want - what we all want - is to be happy! Once we know underlying architecture we can pseudo-deterministically design lifestyles that satisfying the following constraints:

* can robustly satisfy the needs of an autistic individual (and no need for one-size-fits-all when we have the blueprints in front of us!)
* can easily co-exist with neurotypical people
* are well documented

Please do!

## Isaac

god I love you so much

this is SO NICELY STACKED

ten points dude, wild applause

## Aaron

Haha thanks you so much

_\*takes a bow\*_

## Isaac

> ohhhhh. I wonder if we're probability fields. like if that's the boundary of a discrete "self". maybe probability itself is the substrate of consciousness. looking through a probability field labeled "Isaac", I see what I'm likely to see given the makeup of that probability field. my observation matches my essence. to evolve my observation, I must evolve myself.

this is from yesterday — and this morning I had _just in that moment_ gotten as far as linking emotions to probability fields when you texted 🤩 I am having a MARVELOUS time

## Aaron

Haha excellent Yeah I think there’s a lot of “probability stuff” involved. Especially when you start drawing out the associations we learn between concepts and how those “stored data” interact with the input from the “prioritizing stuff” circuitry.

## Isaac

your writing carries the antidote for all terrible quotation mark usage

thank you

may I integrate your messages here into my writing process? a probable effect of this would be your messages from this morning landing in the isaacbowen.com repo

nooooooo expectation/pressure obvs!

## Aaron

That’s fine! Theres a decent amount of vulnerability for me in these ideas. This is some of my best work haha

## Isaac

> vulnerability\
> some of my best work

this is sacred to me 🤲

## Aaron

Just wanted to acknowledge that for myself :D

Go for it!

## Isaac

lolol I’m copying and pasting between things here

I didn’t expect myself to arrive at a place where I have strong opinions about mime types and clipboard contents and how content representations are chosen for multi-typed clipboards

but here we are lol

## Aaron

Also, if we’re speaking about strict accuracy, I think these ideas work at a high-level, but in practice things might look a little different when it comes to implementing something. So take it with a grain of salt is what I mean haha

IE my circuit design skills are pretty basic and a little rusty haha

## Isaac

no sweat

my current view is that every system has a hole in it, and that this is a feature and not a flaw

## Aaron

👌 sweet

Oh LOL I meant Occam’s razor. Sorry Malcom.

## Isaac

hahahahahaha and I’m a straightforward-enough thinker that I carefully weeded out all the search results mentioning “occam” so as to get to a definition for “malcolm’s razor” specifically

hahahahahahahahaha

I learned about so many philosophical razors this year, I was like

“oh awesome! I love collecting these!” 😂 😂 😂

## Aaron

😂😂
