## what do I pack in my suitcase?

pick one strategy:

1. what will you want to wear?
2. what does your suitcase want to hold?

## when are hallucinations useful?

creation.

## if you only had consciousness while you were evaluating a problem, what would you do?

design an infinite problem maybe?

media in that would probably couldn’t be inline storage

it’d have to be address-based

could we encode the whole thing into its address?

isn’t that just inline storage?

well…

what if the address started with a constant element and then as you provide additional clarifying details the media retrieved adapts?

what would have to be true for that to work?

## a non-existent coin is being flipped

we are experiencing it landing heads up

of course probability works in our favor

## casinos are like frottage for universal consciousness

## “I know it’s normal, but I can’t give you any examples”
