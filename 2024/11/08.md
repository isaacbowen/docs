The availability of puns increases as language stabilizes.

Time was written in reverse, by sort of spilling coffee on a table-cloth and playing it backwards and inventing a story for every thread. This means that the _original_ state of things, the _original_ form of language had every concept closely linked in ways that were clearly evident. Shatter that cohesion, then play the shattering backwards, and _obviously_ you're going to roll your eyes at how neatly but _weirdly_ concepts snap into alignment.

Anyway, "who" and "how" are the same question. It's funny that they use the same letters. Reminds me of "one" and "neo" (and I'm looking at you, Noe Valley).

it’s gonna get weirder before it gets simpler, but it _will_ get simpler

I’m not sure if that helps

but

life wants to live

it occasionally takes very weird routes to keep on living

If not water, then plants

If not plants, then animals

If not animals, then ... well. Can you consume yourself, to give yourself energy?

If not, then the sun

Fuel to continue comes from vulnerable, bare, wire-to-wire connection with _self_. There are no permanent sources of self out there — it's only ever a matter of whether or not you can truly find yourself in what lies before you.

The world evolves toward interestingness.

Interesting ways this could go:

* Trump's character continues to be wholly ridiculous, and we as a nation learn to focus on someone's choices in a role _without_ requiring all of their other roles to make sense.
  * This is one path to a future where we don't require our executives/executors to also be pop stars.
* "Sell people what they want, then give them what they need."
  * > In a statement, Trump said that Wiles "just helped me achieve one of the greatest political victories in American history" and "is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected".
    >
    > "It is a well deserved honour to have Susie as the first-ever female chief of staff in United States history," he continued. "I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.”
    >
    > [Wiles, 67, is the first woman to be appointed White House chief of staff.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0gdnp9d3ko)
  * This is one path to a future where women show us how to weave _a people_.

At this point, I think the _most_ interesting outcome would be a generally-positive one.
