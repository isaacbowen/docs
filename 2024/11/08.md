The availability of puns increases as language stabilizes.

Time was written in reverse, by sort of spilling coffee on a table-cloth and playing it backwards and inventing a story for every thread. This means that the _original_ state of things, the _original_ form of language had every concept closely linked in ways that were clearly evident. Shatter that cohesion, then play the shattering backwards, and _obviously_ you're going to roll your eyes at how neatly but _weirdly_ concepts snap into alignment.

Anyway, "who" and "how" are the same question. It's funny that they use the same letters. Reminds me of "one" and "neo" (and I'm looking at you, Noe Valley.)

If not water, then plants

If not plants, then animals

If not animals, then ... well. Can you consume yourself, to give yourself energy?

If not, then the sun

Fuel to continue comes from vulnerable, bare, wire-to-wire connection with _self_. There are no permanent sources of self out there â€” it's only ever a matter of whether or not you can truly find yourself in what lies before you.
