... is the domain I'm using for this. It cost $1,400, and is simultaneously a visual representative of the three-body solution (count the circles) and a redefinition of "OOO" as that most cherished of all acronyms. "Out Of Office", indeed. We've all had quite enough of that.

I'm chuckling as I work, realizing now that I think this is my last software project.

This is almost certainly not true, but the feeling is true. :) First Locksmith, then Mechanic, and now OOO. And then I'm clocking out. ;)

For those of you who _experience_ me clocking out after this, breathe easy. I'm not writing this from a timeline where I'll experience that. Which is gonna be weird for the version of you that reads this. **I'm out because you don't need me anymore. (link)**

Gosh I'm so tempted to not go back and actually link that piece. I originally wrote this on my writing tablet, where I don't have internet and such; that emphasis there was to help me remember to link that up.

But this is not a terribly useful place to prod the mind, so here's the relevant material:

For the rest of us, _game on_.
