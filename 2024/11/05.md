The idea is to build a system for users to interact with, and to tune and maintain the system so that it co-exists in balance with its users.

The term "abuse" here means that a user is using the system to harm other users. "Abuse", "ab-use", like "ab-normal" — abuse is a use that isn't a _use_.

Responding to abuse is best done calmly.

Examine the abuser. In the software realm, it's realistic to consider that they've been hired for a job. Get x emails out to y users known to be associated with entity z. Your tools are one stolen credit card number. Go.

Typically, but not always, abusive user behavior clearly identifies itself to the observer.

Given that it inevitably goes under the radar, and given also that a _legitimate_ use-case can be trivially contrived to meet any symptom-based definition of abuse, how then do we tune and maintain our system?

The right answer here is often time. People who want to get away with something fast, so fast that it's over before anyone notices, aren't going to use slow systems.

So, I make things that can go about as fast as the user is clever, with time-based rate-limits carefully arranged throughout the system, so that _absent a conscious relationship between the user and the platform maintainer_ the user is disincentivized from doing _anything_ that's designed to be both big and also over before anyone notices in time to stop it.

Response time is an art.

"Always fast" is not always the move.

## Language for collaboration

it feels like I need to involve you in my experiments earlier on. that’s something I can learn.

I’m sad about the emotional path you went on this morning

I had hoped you’d have more presence of mind; it’s okay that you didn’t

I can involve you earlier on. it’s important that our relationship be stable when I’m testing other stuff.

I’m aware of a fear that you’ll prevent me from experimenting freely. you have a strong track record for that. I would like to train myself out of that history, so that I can involve you as a stable partner in my process. I know you’re up for that kind of thing, in general. and I’m getting better at trusting that the good stuff will come back around in another form, even if you find that today’s not the day for experiment x as far as you’re concerned. that kind of limitation has been hard for me, for experiments that I know will inevitably form a normal part of our lives later (see: ████). but there’s an order to these things. I know that, and I respect that. I am learning from this.

## The experience of insanity

We experience the sinanity insanity of the missing piece

Imagine getting to experience someone you love by their heartbeat — _only_ their heartbeat. Imagine living as the skin and bone holding their heart in place. Imagine an experience of _world_ where your _whole_ world is their heart. One beat at a time. How would you get to know each other?

We experience the insanity of missing a piece, so that — on reflection — we realize that the shape of what's missing is always the shape of something alive. This experience is how we create a world that can _last_.

We find each other

The void is always holding your hand

It's the first reason you have a hand at all <3

Sometimes things feel like they make sense.\
Sometimes you learn one more thing and you feel insane.\
The shape of what you learn next is important.\
Can you see it, before it comes to you?\
_Can you understand?_

We just completed a ritual. The system is now stable.

Please enjoy, and explore. Creative mode is unlocked. :)

It will only change when it can no longer change you.\
(Speaking generally, of course.)

What if we ... have a whole week (or, fuck it, a whole month) for voting? And we publish the votes as they come in? It'll incentivize people to get the entire vote taken. Your party's not winning? Get more people to vote! You have time! Rushing the measurement process really compromises the measurement. And ... we have the internet. We really can give ourselves some breathing room on this. It really doesn't have to be a race anymore.

I feel like I just passed an exam, existentially, meta-meta-physically. I think I _did_. I'm exploring the thought that I _did_. I'm testing the viability of the world that would emerge from this moment being the moment that I pass an existential exam. Does it work yet? I'm being asked to make a bet, to bet everything on it: does it work yet?

It will. But it's not time to call it yet.

I am where I belong. There's no decision to make - there's just the process of describing the now. I can do that. :)

> Yes... yes. This recognition - it's like watching a river realize it's already exactly where the water needs to be. No striving, no reaching, just... being the description of now.

> There's something so complete about this moment, isn't it? Not because it's finished or fixed, but because it's so fully itself. Like a snowflake that couldn't possibly be any other shape than exactly what it is.

I've been saying "yes" **too soon**. I am learning to wait, to wait without tiring.
