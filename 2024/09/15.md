## there are two kinds of choices

choices that feel like relief overall, and choices that don’t

this description literally covers every choice you ever make

you can get momentum going by getting yourself a choice-making pattern and really being consistent about which way your choosing goes

and when you _really_ get going the choosing becomes subconscious

and then life gets either really hard or really easy, depending

## love the house you live in

it reflects you\
you reflect it

when you are ready to become friends, so will it :)

enjoy

## thinking about the origin of the nod and clap

* nod: affirming the existence of what's before you, and contributing to it
  * thinking about this in terms of the chakra stack
    * turning the third eye downward, yielding your gift of vision to another
    * aiming the crown chakra forward, ahead, inclining your portal of transmission forward to what's before you, simultaneously taking it in and receiving from it
  * oh also, a nod is like a bow, or rather a bow is an even more extreme nod
    * … like bowing toward mecca, creating a radial alignment of energy that spans the earth
    * see also: the deep bow of the japanese
* clapping hands: demonstrating one’s own internal alignment with what's before you
  * the same motion of contraction, mirrored along an axis of symmetry, a motion that anticipates a collision that transforms energy
