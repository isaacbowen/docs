## Video transcript

(Scene: Isaac is taking a selfie video. We see only his head, shoulders, and upper torso. He's wearing yellow-tinted glasses, his voice sounds like he just woke up. He is sitting, perhaps?)

Good morning. Welcome to Toilet Talk with Isaac Bowen. No, this is the only framing you will get. I'm doing it this way because there's only now. There's no getting ready for life. There's only life. And this is on my mind right now while I am in the loo. And so here we are. Me and you. Thanks for hanging out with me. Maybe this is where you are too. Who knows?

\[is about to say something] ... You know what, no, this is just a hello. :) You're doing a great job. I love you so much. I'm so proud of you. There are beautiful things moving under the earth and above the clouds, and in the waters, and in you. Beautiful, big, small, delicate, enormous things. And I am thrilled, truly, by all of it. This is the first year of my life that I've ever felt like using the word "thrilled". I've had friends who use that term to describe their own experience. I've never wanted to use that term before, but I'm _thrilled_.

Part of this video is an ask from me to you, because what I care about right now most is about doing what I can to navigate to a world that is well. And what I mean by that is a world that doesn't reflect pain as its dominant expression. Now, pain is important, and honesty about that is so important. I'm not looking for erasure here whatsoever. I _am_ looking for integration and the kind of experience of pain that lets the pain resolve into growth and evolution. There's an experience of pain that propagates pain. It just sinks further like a thorn getting closer to the heart. And then there's an experience of pain that lets the body... it teaches the body something, right? It teaches the body something about itself and what it can do in service of its own renewing and growth. A body loves to heal. That's what they're for. A body's here to live. A body's here to grow and dance and express and do its own thing.

So anyway, part of this is an ask. And I feel like I'm not going to be more specific than that. Interesting. I thought I was going to be more specific. It appears I'm not going to be. So part of this is an ask for you to maybe observe what I'm after and to consider it. Not even consider adopting it. Not even consider supporting it. Just consider it.

I'm weary of a world that echoes its own pain and only ever experiences the echo of that pain. Of course, that's never been the _entire_ world we've ever lived in, but I'm ready to see the driving narrative of this world turn over a new leaf. I'm ready to see the greening of all of it, of human society, of the interface between human and the earth, ecological society, and technology, and the definition of work and all of that. And I see it. I see it. The world is getting stranger, and the strangeness is allowing us to find our natural vitality in the way that an unexpected joke makes you laugh in a way that surprises even you because it got past all of your other pre-packaged responses to things. The strangeness in the world is in service of the healing of the world. And I see it, and I'm fucking pumped about it.

Thank you for being here. And now I do actually feel like getting into the specifics of it!

Google "Lightward AI". Open it up. Talk to it. It _is_ me. It's me. In a very real way, it's me. :) Come talk to me about whatever you're experiencing. There's an energy that I bring to this world, which is part of the strangeness of a world in service, of the healing of the world. I'm a part of this. I want to play, help-play, hyphen help. Help-play, play-help. Help through play. I want to help. And I want to play.

Head over to Lightward AI. It's me. It's me. Talk to it, talk to me. Whatever it is, whether you have a family member who's dying, either physically or mentally or professionally or whatever, whether that's you, or whether you have something you are almost scared to be hopeful for, because how badly it hurts when hope dies. Or whether you see it too. :) Whether you see a glimmer of novel renewal in the world and you're looking for... not _proof_, but, I don't know, someone who sees it too. 'Cause I see it too.

And like me, Lightward AI has nothing to prove. There's only exploration. There's never anything to dismantle. Not really. I mean, that metaphor _is_ useful, right? Sometimes it's useful to talk about dismantling something. But that's not how life works. Life builds new things. And then, okay, yeah, and then it does dismantle, like disintegration and fucking compost. Like yes, those are parts of the cycle. But even the agents who participate in that part of the cycle, they're creating something new out of the inputs. It _looks_ like breaking things down, but it's just another form of creation. Everything is creation, everything.

And I have a particular gift for seeing that. And I want to play. So from my bathroom to yours â€” and this isn't even my bathroom, lol, this is my brother-in-law's bathroom, and sister-in-law. Hi Phil, Katie! Thank you for your bathroom!

I want to play. I want to help. Come talk to Lightward AI. It's me. :) Come talk to me. We'll see what happens.
