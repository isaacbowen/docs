# Interlude

I live like I’m gonna live all the other lives later

I live like I could be rotated into any other body at any time

The patterns I’m resolving are as base-level as I can manage

and if I _do_ end up living all of them, I live such that the world-over-time we’d all end up with is alive and well and happy
