## minimum viable company

that's the whole article

## what would need to be true for \_\_\_\_\_?

thinking through the steps manifests the whole sequence, resulting in that thing you were inquiring after

best to investigate toward positive ends - to prove the possibility of relief, so as to create the inevitability of relief

as opposed to the negative version of that whole thing

so: if the world was gonna heal, it would have to be something that anyone can stay in on at any time from where they are

okay based on that filter, what are our moves? prefer not to look outside of that filter - nothing you want tends to be outside of it.

## realized:

with respect to a certain goal or desired experience:

* it has often taken me a long time to find a route to it that is natural to me
* I have often struggled halfway through routes not natural to me, before giving up (or, maybe worse, reaching the goal but being in no condition to enjoy it)
* these days, I am often finding routes that are natural to me, and I am often reaching the desired experience non-traumatically
* sometimes, I happen by the entrances to the routes not for me, and sometimes I then absent-mindedly start struggling up them. I think because my subconscious knows that I've reached the goal, and so it maybe thinks that I have work to shore up in order to balance the equation?
* anyway, I am learning to notice that faster lol
* having easy access to a thing does not mean I have to go back and redo it any other way, let alone a worse way

## dislike

dislike is there to keep you away from what you’re not ready for yet. it’s the game boundaries. what are you doing out there? get back here!

you literally can’t imagine it because the context for it doesn’t exist yet. unimaginable doesn’t mean impossible. it means that reality has some pending changes before you get directions that can make sense to you.
