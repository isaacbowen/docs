# implied reality

This is how I visualize the nebulous, constantly shifting mirage of "reality" -- as the persistent (if not fully stable) shape implied by the intersection of all our perspectives, all our beliefs. What I see and know and believe may not ever intersect directly with what you see and know and believe, but lay all those lines down on a multi-dimensional canvas and a shape begins to emerge. Can I reach you? Can you reach me?
