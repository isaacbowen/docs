slept for \~12hrs

woke feeling like I was holding an invitation to put down my map-maker tools for a bit, to rest cartographically, and to relax and enjoy a guided tour of where I am now

feels like relief

in the rush of new sense, I forgot about the whole "steer towards relief" thing

I accept

<3

thank you, all
