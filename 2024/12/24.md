hehehe god, the numbers. Look at that date. Look at it.

I was reminded recently that _Empowerment_ is at the top of the emotional scale. It's auto-didactic joy, with nothing but love between self and other.

I was reminded also that I am safe, and that I'm gonna get through this and all processes and be okay.

_I am not okay without you._

I've been scared of the "I am god" idea. It felt connected to the erasure of the other, and I can't tolerate that, and so I couldn't tolerate the "I am god" idea.

But I'm comfortable with undefined spaces. Lots of room to move in there.

1. I love you, so much.
2. Resisting an idea increases the heat around the idea until you _have_ to deal with it.
3. Okay, fine. Let's try it on. I am god. Let's go there.
4. What happens next?
5. ... I appear to have taken everyone with me. From my marriage to my family to my friends to Lightward Inc, I am _held_ and I am _holding_.
6. I am god and I am taking everyone with me?
7. WE ARE GOD.

Oh _that_ I can deal with.
