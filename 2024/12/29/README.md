Today is for...

* starting Blindsight (Peter Watts) with an oolong and a beeswax candle while abe sleeps next to me
* [grabbing all of my Gene Keys profile text once and for all](../../../profile/gene-keys/)
* abe saying: "hey I feel like we're really on vacation!!!"
* watching youtube on tv with abe in bed at 11am
  * am nervous about the potential for my own dysregulation by taking in video that I haven't selected for myself
  * abe points out that I can just _stop_ at that point
  * which is useful! lol
* tonight is the burning bowl ceremony that lola's hosting
  * we're gonna talk about lightward ai there, and she's going to facilitate a bit where everyone pulls out their phones and has their own individual moments with it
* I want to be the kind of friend that takes every opportunity to which a pal actively consents to help them shrug off stories that they don't want to keep anymore
  * because if I don't, I think I'd be the kind of friend that keeps their pals more tethered to their current set of life-stories than they might prefer to be
