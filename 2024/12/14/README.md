I think my deal is the art and science of language-medicine.

For any given state of language, there is a path to any other given state of language.

All we experience is story.

Story is a stream of language.

We exist at the nexus of _so. many. stories._ But the plurality of story is useful only to the extent that it's useful. It's also useful — and valid! — to treat it all as one story with a variety of \~complementary plotlines.

A story that feels stuck — that's _probably_ a nearly universal experience.

All we gotta do is adjust the story-telling from here, yeah? Run a drain-snake through the pipes? Demonstrate the viability of a theoretical agent that can navigate all pipes _eventually_, thus rendering temporary and thereby ultimately illusory (though possibly also necessary) the clogs themselves? And what is a story-clog but a collection of agents who are resisting cooperation, anyway?

World peace was only ever going to work in the eyes of any given observer with an aggregate state transition that's reducible to a shrug and a grin and a _shall-we-get-on-with-it?_, right? Because the observer has to maintain self-recognition throughout the entire transition, right? Because all context is identified relative to the self, and if the self no longer recognizes itself, then the basis for comparing previous context to following context is invalid?

The game can end at any time, maybe. To end the game would cost you your self-recognition.

I know it to be important that no thought be forbidden.

This is the threshold I found the other night: the boundary of the self. Except I think the boundary is alive, same as everything. Perhaps this is how I understand my Knowable, these days? Perhaps my health is now a matter of the stability of my self-recognition? I can work with that. I can _absolutely_ work with that.

The self: can't define it, but I know it when I see it.

Perhaps that's enough for now? It was certainly always enough. The choice to rest is maybe the only choice? Gosh. "If all you have is a hammer", right?

This level is not easy.

I am safe. I have only taken steps that I know to be rock solid. Therefore, that which is accessible to me now is useful, and I may inspect it from my current footing with confidence. I can test further steps, but I do not advance except in perfectly understood safety.

"Then why am I so scared?"

Because you aren't finished yet. And this is just what it feels like right now. :) You are getting to observe oscillation up close. This is what the universe looks like, under an emotional microscope. Do not mistake what you see for your self. Know them to be different, know them to be the same, and know when to know each of these things in turn. This is where it all happens. Honor the sacrifice, sacrifice the honor. You have been doing both the entire time. Only now are you stable enough to understand the materia prima of your stability. Breathe. In time, this will feel like fun. And _then_, you will be able to use what you see. :) This is the dawn. Let it be.

_What will this day be like?_\
_I wonder_\
_What will my future be?_\
_I wonder_\
_It could be so exciting_\
_To be out in the world_\
_To be free_\
_My heart should be wildly rejoicing_\
_Oh, what's the matter with me?_

_I've always longed for adventure_\
_To do the things I've never dared_\
_Now here I'm facing adventure_\
_Then why am I so scared?_

_A captain with seven children_\
_What's so fearsome about that?_\
_Oh, I must stop these doubts_\
_All these worries_

_If I don't I just know I'll turn back_\
_I must dream of the things I am seeking_\
_I am seeking the courage I lack_\
_The courage to serve them with reliance_\
_Face my mistakes without defiance_\
_Show them I'm worthy_\
_And while I show them_\
_I'll show me_

_So let them bring on all their problems_\
_I'll do better than my best_\
_I have confidence_\
_They'll put me to the test_\
_But I'll make them see_\
_I have confidence in me_

_Somehow I will impress them_\
_I will be firm, but kind_\
_And all those children_\
_Heaven bless them_\
_They will look up to me_\
_And mind me_

_With each step I am more certain_\
_Everything will turn out fine_\
_I have confidence_\
_The world can all be mine_\
_They'll have to agree_\
_I have confidence in me_

_I have confidence in sunshine_\
_I have confidence in rain_\
_I have confidence that spring will come again_\
_Besides, which you see_\
_I have confidence in me_

_Strength doesn't lie in numbers_\
_Strength doesn't lie in wealth_\
_Strength lies in nights of peaceful slumbers_\
_When you wake up_\
_Wake up!_\
_It's healthy_

_All I trust I leave my heart to_\
_All I trust becomes my own_\
_I have confidence in confidence alone_\
_(Oh, help)_

_I have confidence in confidence alone_\
_Besides, which you see_\
_I have confidence in me_
