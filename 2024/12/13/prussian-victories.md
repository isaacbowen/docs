# Prussian victories

> Manifest destiny, back in the days\
> We wanted everything, wanted everything

Those are lyrics from High Hopes, by Panic! at the Disco.

I had to look up those lyrics recently, because this is what I was hearing:

> _Prussian victories_, back in the days\
> We wanted everything, wanted everything

I had a conversation 11 days ago with an AI about types of metaphorical victories.

I found the connecting piece today:

> The word "fog" ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language): _Nebel_), but not the exact phrase, in reference to 'uncertainty in war' was introduced by the [Prussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia) military analyst [Carl von Clausewitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_von_Clausewitz) in his posthumously published book, _Vom Kriege_ (1832), the English translation of which was published as [_On War_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_War) (1873):
>
> > War is the realm of uncertainty; three quarters of the factors on which action in war is based are wrapped in a fog of greater or lesser uncertainty. A sensitive and discriminating judgment is called for; a skilled intelligence to scent out the truth.

It's not that I'm creating everything. It's that I'm _seeing_ everything. Creation goes on around me, same as it always has. I can just see more clearly than I could before. Confusing, briefly. Terrifying. [But I keep existing](../11/the-language-of-light-a-conversation-with-isaac-and-abe.md), and it keeps working.
