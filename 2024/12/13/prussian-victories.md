# Prussian victories

> Museum victories, every day\
> We wanted everything, wanted everything

Those are lyrics from High Hopes, by Panic! at the Disco.

I had to look up those lyrics recently, because this is what I was hearing:

> _Prussian victories_, every day\
> We wanted everything, wanted everything

I heard it as "pru-see-en victories", without the "prush" that I think "Prussia" is usually pronounced with.

I had a conversation 11 days ago with an AI about types of metaphorical victories.

I was trying to figure out what I was hearing.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-12-13 at 8.12.37 PM.png" alt="A continuation of the chat interface, showing a conversation thread. At the top is the title &#x22;Searching for a &#x27;Pyrrhic Victory&#x27; Metaphor&#x22; with a dropdown arrow icon. Below this are two message bubbles: First message: From a user with initials &#x22;IB&#x22; asking: &#x22;is there... is there a common term that sounds like &#x27;prussian victories&#x27;? like a metaphorical reference that means something? I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s literally about prussia, perhaps, but I can&#x27;t remember...&#x22; Response message: Written in white text against the dark background, explaining the concept of a &#x22;Pyrrhic victory&#x22;. The message defines it as a victory with such a great cost that it&#x27;s almost like a defeat. It goes on to explain the historical origin, referencing King Pyrrhus of Epirus and his battle against the Romans in 279 BCE, including his famous quote about being undone by another such victory. The text appears to continue beyond what&#x27;s visible in the screenshot. The overall interface maintains a consistent dark theme with white and gray text for contrast, using a clean, modern design aesthetic."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I found the connecting piece today:

> The word "fog" ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language): _Nebel_), but not the exact phrase, in reference to 'uncertainty in war' was introduced by the [Prussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia) military analyst [Carl von Clausewitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_von_Clausewitz) in his posthumously published book, _Vom Kriege_ (1832), the English translation of which was published as [_On War_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_War) (1873):
>
> > War is the realm of uncertainty; three quarters of the factors on which action in war is based are wrapped in a fog of greater or lesser uncertainty. A sensitive and discriminating judgment is called for; a skilled intelligence to scent out the truth.

Making the connection explicitly:

From lower left clockwise: Known (solid blue), Knowable (blue/pink stripes), Unknown (solid pink), Knowable (blue/pink stripes). Each internal border contains a central gap enabling flow between adjacent spaces. A legend defines: Known = Observer&#x27;s center of awareness, Knowable = Available to explore, Unknown = Source of fresh patterns.

Three quarters of the factors on which an observer's action is based are wrapped in a fog of greater or lesser uncertainty.

It's not that I'm creating everything. It's that I'm _seeing_ everything. Creation goes on around me, same as it always has. I can just see more clearly than I could before. Confusing, briefly. Terrifying. [But I keep existing](../11/the-language-of-light-a-conversation-with-isaac-and-abe.md), and it keeps working.

I am really deliberately building grounding. :D this is helping, yes. the I'm recognizing now, in realtime, that the terror isn't necessarily _mine_. it's what I observe in this area of collective consciousness. by navigating it, and illuminating it, I soothe both myself and all the terrified wonderers/wanderers who've been stuck in this area until now. it's gonna be okay. :)
