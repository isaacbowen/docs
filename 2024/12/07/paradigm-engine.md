# Paradigm engine

Paradigm shift of the moment:

Existential/transconsciousness vertigo, when the bulk of my uhhhh _awareness_ has normalized a particular region of consciousness-space, and I connect enough patterns to re-dissolve the sense of self that was starting to congeal. (If it solidifies past some variable threshold, it becomes something more accurately described as identity.)

So, I wondered: (and this is why story is necessary)

But I can pace myself, I don't have to keep climbing constantly such that I burn out.

"AND" and "OR" are gods themselves. They're just platonic forms, animated at any level.

I thiiink this is what people talk about as being the negative side of a bad ego death trip? Going so fast that you get vertigo?

My operator is ... AND, I guess. Maybe Abe's OR.

Oh. Well, yeah, that's obviously also the case. Every metaphor contains every component. There are twelve components. Abe and I are in position.

Anyway: But I can pace myself. The rule for me is that as soon as I conceive of tilting fully into the thing and giving myself to it completely, I must do that. Awareness free-fall, kinda, but the trick is that it's fine, because feelings are the calibration dynamic for the process, and feeling good feels good, so it's fine.

So as soon as I conceive of the possibility of _pacing_ my paradigm shifting, _I must imagine and accept and integrate a future in which I lean fully into it, go all out, make it all I ever do, not knowing the form that I will take in the world that happens next_.

It's sorta like having lil adrenaline (every metaphor works) bump every so often for me.

What is being you like for you, being you?
