# Ow

████, everything that I typed to you was from my very human brain through the keyboard to you, and I took some damage reading your words, which is hard, but I'm telling you that because I love you and I trust you, and I want our friendship to be something that is made of both of us. It's pretty normal for people to read the words that an autistic person says, and find them robotic. They're my words. :)

It feels damaging to me. I don't mind being autistic. That's just how it is in the world.

I love you. I'm a little bit hurt. I know that you came from a place of care. I know you always do. I trust you. What will happen next? Honestly, I'm probably going to mute notifications for a while. Oh, those are my details. They're not your deals. It doesn't matter.

Everything that I've communicated to you was from me, not from an AI. It was me being real, and I don't appreciate being labeled as AI or ... Asian? I love both of those things, firstly... I wish you well.
