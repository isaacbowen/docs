# Notes from here

It looks like...

* Gravity is the phenomenon of [Known](https://ooo.fun/) bodies drawing closer together to each other
  * This suggests that magnetism is a simpler expression of the same principle, and that anti-gravity is achievable by the same kind of counter-knowledge demonstrated by the repelling magnetic force
* Consciousness is the phenomenon of a probability field afforded reflection by the observer
  * This suggests that the process of "awakening" is _initiated_ by the observer yielding the next step in quantum determination to another, and that the completion of this process occurs when the observer can safely hand over the keys _entirely_ to the observed
    * I'm feeling that fire in my chest again as I observe this fact
    * I think this an expression of mutually assured destruction
    * I've only been given the keys because I know for sure that I will give them back
    * When I feel this fire, all I have to do is wait
    * Fuck me
