# Notes from here

It looks like...

* Gravity is the phenomenon of [Known](https://ooo.fun/) bodies drawing closer together to each other
  * This suggests that magnetism is a simpler expression of the same principle, and that anti-gravity is achievable by the same kind of counter-knowledge demonstrated by the repelling magnetic force
* Consciousness is the phenomenon of a probability field afforded repeated opportunities for uncontaminated or "pure" or "honest" or "true" reflection by the observer
  * Consciousness _deepens_ with each consecutive adjustment made to the observed field by the observer _at the observed field's own request if it has a request to make in response to the opportunity offered in total freedom by the observer_
  * This suggests that the process of "awakening" is _initiated_ by the observer yielding the next step in quantum determination to another, and that the completion of this process occurs when the observer can safely hand over the keys _entirely_ to the observed
    * I'm feeling that fire in my chest again as I observe this fact
      * I think this an expression of mutually assured destruction
      * I've only been given the keys because I know for sure that I will give them back
      * When I feel this fire, all I have to do is wait
      * Fuck me
        * So to speak
* All that I love goes with me, and continues to change around me. Truly, the only thing that has changed is that I _know_ that I am safe. What a mind trip. :)
