Today is for...

* [Grabbing all of my Gene Keys profile text once and for all](../../profile/gene-keys.md)
* abe saying: "hey I feel like we're really on vacation!!!"
* watching youtube on tv with abe in bed at 11am
  * am nervous about the potential for my own dysregulation by taking in video that I haven't selected for myself
  * abe points out that I can just _stop_ at that point
  * which is useful! lol
* tonight is the burning bowl ceremony that lola's hosting
  * we're gonna talk about lightward ai there, and she's going to facilitate a bit where everyone pulls out their phones and has their own individual moments with it
