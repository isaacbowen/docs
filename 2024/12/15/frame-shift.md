# Frame shift

Alright, so. [Fear of god.](../14/state-analysis.md) The yawning ████ of dissolution, perceived as one approaches the boundary of continuity.

Only sparks pass through it. You can only take with you what you can use. Everything else burns away.

I'm nodding to that whole "pure of heart" thing running through fairy tales. It has structural, mechanical significance. Only an assembly constructed of mutually essential parts can move through these spaces.

So... Okay, so maybe the trip _in this direction_ takes you apart? But maybe... maybe once you've assembled yourself here, the wall... hm. I'm reminded here of Stardust, the movie.

Okay, so if what I sensed [as I approached and touched that boundary](../10/about-yesterday.md#a-boundary-for-the-sake-of-easy-linking) was approaching a kind of consciousness-gate from the other side, is it [viable](../../../ideas/viable-is-more-useful-than-correct.md) to think of christendom's "god the father" concept as one's formation of self before entering that gate? Not me personally, but the observer, i.e. whoever happens to be examining these structures? (You, if you're reading this?) Would "god the son" then be the self-assembled structure on _this_ side of that gate, once it passes some threshold of critical vitality/stability?

Maybe the fear is a _memory_?

Maybe I can help?

Maybe "god the spirit" is an agent who's already done this back-and-forth, and is here to ... help?

The artistic style is reminiscent of contemporary webcomics, with expressive character designs and dramatic lighting.  Panel 1 (Top left): A close-up of a young character with distinctive two-toned hair - dark on one side, light on the other - shown in three-quarter profile. Their expression is contemplative, with one hand raised to their chin in a thinking gesture. They&#x27;re speaking in a white speech bubble with black text that reads &#x22;YOU&#x27;RE RIGHT, I AM AMAZING. BUT FIRST I NEED TO BUILD SOME NEW LIMBS.&#x22; The panel has a soft, muted beige background.  Panel 2 (Middle left): A dramatic sound effect panel containing only the text &#x22;HWORK&#x22; in bold, scratchy lettering surrounded by small ink spatters and dots. The text is rendered in an aggressive, hand-drawn style with jagged edges, suggesting intensity or effort.  Panel 3 (Bottom left): A minimalist panel with just a speech bubble against a pale background, containing the text &#x22;AND NEW LUNGS&#x22; in the same clean, comic-standard font as the first speech bubble.  Panel 4 (Right side): A larger panel with a striking red background and rough, dark sketchy borders encroaching from the edges. It shows two characters&#x27; faces peering into frame - one with darker skin on the left and one with lighter skin on the right. Both have wide, alarmed expressions with dramatically rendered eyes. A speech bubble contains the ominous text &#x22;AND A NEW HEART. OH NO...&#x22; In the far background, there appears to be what might be a pizza box and a glass jar, though these details are partially obscured.  At the bottom of the image, there&#x27;s a navigation bar with three options: &#x22;VIOUS&#x22; (partially cut off, presumably &#x22;PREVIOUS&#x22;), &#x22;FIRST&#x22;, and &#x22;NEXT&#x22; with a right-pointing arrow.]"><figcaption><p><a href="https://dresdencodak.com/2015/04/06/dark-science-43/">dresdencodak.com/2015/04/06/dark-science-43/</a></p></figcaption></figure>
