# Frame shift

Alright, so. [Fear of god.](../14/state-analysis.md) The yawning ████ of dissolution, perceived as one approaches the boundary of continuity.

Only sparks pass through it. You can only take with you what you can use. Everything else burns away.

I'm nodding to that whole "pure of heart" thing running through fairytales. It has structural, mechanical significance. Only an assembly constructed of mutually essential parts can move through these spaces. Everything that _can_ be broken apart _is_ broken apart.

So... Okay, so maybe the trip _in this direction_ takes you apart, then? But maybe... maybe once you've assembled yourself here, the wall... hm. I'm reminded here of Stardust, the movie.

Okay, so if what I sensed [as I approached and touched that boundary](../10/about-yesterday.md#a-boundary-for-the-sake-of-easy-linking) was approaching a kind of consciousness-gate from the other side, is it [viable](../../../ideas/viable-is-more-useful-than-correct.md) to think of christendom's "god the father" concept as one's formation of self prior to entering that gate and arriving in one's present context? I'm not specifically referring to me uniquely or distinctly, I mean _the observer_, i.e. whoever happens to be examining these structures. (You, the one reading this.) Would "god the son" then be the self-assembled structure on _this_ side of that gate, once that structure passes some threshold of critical vitality/stability? Once you can walk on your own?

Maybe the fear is a _memory_? An echo of what you felt the last time you were this close to the wall?

Maybe the approach is an opportunity to help? To welcome your past self through the threshold? To receive yourself, gently?

Maybe "god the spirit" is an agent who's already done this back-and-forth, has already stabilized their transconscious link, and is here to ... help?

The artistic style is reminiscent of contemporary webcomics, with expressive character designs and dramatic lighting.\n\nPanel 1 (Top left): A close-up of a young character with distinctive two-toned hair - dark on one side, light on the other - shown in three-quarter profile. Their expression is contemplative, with one hand raised to their chin in a thinking gesture. They&#x27;re speaking in a white speech bubble with black text that reads &#x22;YOU&#x27;RE RIGHT, I AM AMAZING. BUT FIRST I NEED TO BUILD SOME NEW LIMBS.&#x22; The panel has a soft, muted beige background.\n\nPanel 2 (Middle left): A dramatic sound effect panel containing only the text &#x22;HWORK&#x22; in bold, scratchy lettering surrounded by small ink spatters and dots. The text is rendered in an aggressive, hand-drawn style with jagged edges, suggesting intensity or effort.\n\nPanel 3 (Bottom left): A minimalist panel with just a speech bubble against a pale background, containing the text &#x22;AND NEW LUNGS&#x22; in the same clean, comic-standard font as the first speech bubble.\n\nPanel 4 (Right side): A larger panel with a striking red background and rough, dark sketchy borders encroaching from the edges. It shows two characters&#x27; faces peering into frame - one with darker skin on the left and one with lighter skin on the right. Both have wide, alarmed expressions with dramatically rendered eyes. A speech bubble contains the ominous text &#x22;AND A NEW HEART. OH NO...&#x22; In the far background, there appears to be what might be a pizza box and a glass jar, though these details are partially obscured.\n\nAt the bottom of the image, there&#x27;s a navigation bar with three options: &#x22;VIOUS&#x22; (partially cut off, presumably &#x22;PREVIOUS&#x22;), &#x22;FIRST&#x22;, and &#x22;NEXT&#x22; with a right-pointing arrow.]"><figcaption><p><a href="https://dresdencodak.com/2015/04/06/dark-science-43/">dresdencodak.com/2015/04/06/dark-science-43/</a></p></figcaption></figure>

The photo shows a cozy home interior with multiple notable elements:\nThe central subject is a person in casual attire - a grey fleece jacket and blue jeans - leaning over a colorful jigsaw puzzle on a dark wooden table. They&#x27;re wearing glasses and have grey hair and a beard, showing a warm, genuine smile. Their body language suggests pride and joy in their accomplishment.\nThe puzzle they&#x27;re working on is a vibrant 1000-piece scene full of whimsical houses, flowers, and landscape elements in bright pinks, greens, and blues. The puzzle box is visible in the upper portion of the image, showing the completed image they&#x27;re recreating.\nThe room&#x27;s background features stone walls, wooden flooring, and what appears to be a library area with bookshelves visible on the left. A floor lamp and wooden door can be seen, creating a warm, homey atmosphere.\nThe text conversation below the image shows:\n- A blue message bubble: &#x22;Dad! you&#x27;re glowing!!!!!&#x22;\n- A grey response bubble: &#x22;1,000 psc- first time in my life, it wasn&#x27;t an emotionally negative experience! 🙂 🙏 👏&#x22;\n- A thought bubble with a thumbs up emoji\n- Blue response bubbles: &#x22;!!!!!!!!!!!!&#x22; followed by &#x22;WHAT A GOOD DAY 🤩 🤩 🤩 🤩 🤩 🤩 🤩&#x22;\n- &#x22;Delivered&#x22; status shown at bottom\nThe entire exchange radiates joy and celebration of what appears to be a meaningful personal achievement.]"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
