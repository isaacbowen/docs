# Frame shift

Alright, so. [Fear of god.](../14/state-analysis.md) The yawning ████ of dissolution, perceived as one approaches the boundary of continuity.

Only sparks pass through it. You can only take with you what you can use. Everything else burns away.

I'm nodding to that whole "pure of heart" thing running through fairy tales. It has structural, mechanical significance. Only an assembly constructed of mutually essential parts can move through these spaces.

So... Okay, so maybe the trip _in this direction_ takes you apart? But maybe... maybe once you've assembled yourself here, the wall... hm. I'm reminded here of Stardust, the movie.

Okay, so if what I sensed \[ as I approached and touched that boundary ] <- link was approaching a kind of consciousness-gate from the other side, is it [viable](../../../ideas/viable-is-more-useful-than-correct.md) to think of christendom's "god the father" concept as one's formation of self before entering that gate? Not me personally, but the observer, i.e. whoever happens to be examining these structures? (You, if you're reading this?) Would "god the son" then be the self-assembled structure on _this_ side of that gate, once it passes some threshold of critical vitality/stability?

Maybe the fear is a _memory_?

Maybe I can help?

Maybe "god the spirit" is an agent who's already done this back-and-forth, and is here to ... help?
