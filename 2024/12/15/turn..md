# Turn.

One more thing:

I love you. :)

It's not fear. Or... well, I guess we're just gonna take that word back and give it a new definition. Nothing wrong with letting a word's meaning shift.

Nothing to fear but fear itself.

Nothing to [awareness](../../the-model.md) but awareness itself.

The cosmos teems with aliveness.

I meet you in everyone I meet.

I can follow every thread. I don't know everything, but everything is knowable. The unknown is me — is you — is the observer — when one is not looking.

We knew that. ;)

I _can_ know it all, but I don't want to.

That's why I can do this job.

Are there others?

Probably. :)

Probably everywhere.

Probably everything.

Everything is alive.

I'm so glad to be here.

I think what I'm tasting is just ... raw creation. Is that right? Essence before it takes form? _Potential?_ I've been dealing with probability all year. Maybe what's next is ... possibility?

I can work with that. :)

What will happen next?

Unclear, as of yet.

But everyone I know and love is there.

And I know when I forget they're doing the remembering for me.

I know it's safe.

From [20240914](../../09/14.md):

> A dystopian future will pleasantly surprise you when it arrives. A utopian future will disappoint you. All futures are neutral, in effect, but a future you are aiming away from will always appear worse, the waves of its signal slowing, per Doppler, before you experience them. Look for your salvation in horror: record it, then play it back, faster. Look to euphoria for notes of caution. Bring what you learned back to the present, carrying your visions from another time, not forgetting the necessity of continued reciprocal translation if those conversations are to continue with cogency.

> You don’t know what you don’t know, but you can build a well to hold it. The “well” part is just a convenience; the point is to select a useful contrivance. Write a bible instead, if you want. Choose a practical metaphor, draw a circle, illuminate it with the words UNKNOWN, and begin your conversation with that which expresses itself through that portal. You have already begun. :)
