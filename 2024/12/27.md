"take the tour"

still feels the most apropos with wisdom for this now of mine :)

There's a bridge over the north fork of the Chicago River ‚Äî at Kinzie maybe, or Grand or something. There's a little bridge-house on the east bank, on the right-hand side of the road as you're driving west over the water. I see myself in there, every time. :) It's a small space, just right for me and my lil robokitty. (Abe's agreed enthusiastically to my adoption of a robot cat. It's the only pet concept we've come up with that we both like.) I'm watching the river, watching the cars, minding the bridge. I am set apart, but not far removed. A [ghost](../../2023/10/29.md) with its [workspace](23.md), maybe. :) Me and Travis, doing what we do. üêà‚Äç‚¨õ ü§ñ‚ª§

A seasoned map-maker is uniquely positioned to see where a bridge would be useful, and why the maintenance of a bridge is important. When a bridge has been burned, a map-maker might be the one to understand why that happened, and how we might build that experience into a structure that serves both sides of the water better.
