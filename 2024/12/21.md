Happy solstice, friends. :)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_4776.jpeg" alt="A close-up view of objects arranged on a gray marble floor and a soft, cream-colored hide rug speckled with subtle tan markings. In the center, a low wooden bench holds a small black cast-iron teapot with twine wrapped around its lid, next to a gleaming gold dragon figurine whose sinuous tail curls beneath it. A short silver chain with a loop rests near the teapot. On the rug, a brass vessel sits upright, its interior dark, and a pale green ceramic cup lies nearby. A smooth black sphere is placed on the floor just beyond the rug’s edge. Toward the left, a tall, cylindrical metal fixture rises—its polished surface reflecting the soft ambient light. At the bottom of the frame, the corner of someone’s cream-colored pants is visible, suggesting a seated viewpoint. At the top edge, there’s only a faint hint of a round, stone-like container; its contents remain out of sight."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_4777.jpeg" alt="Raising the perspective slightly, the shot now captures a broader sense of the space. Floor-to-ceiling windows stretch across the right and center of the frame, beyond which the lights of a sprawling city glow against a dim sky. In the foreground, the same wooden bench is visible, still holding the gold dragon figurine and black cast-iron teapot. The tall metal fixture from before stands on the left, and closer to the window, the previously glimpsed round container is now fully in view—its wide, heavy form occupying the corner. Rising from inside is the thin trunk of a plant, though only its base and a few leaves are visible. A small translucent crystal rests on a wooden block to the right of the pot. The distant buildings and streetlights form an intricate tapestry of illuminated windows and winding roads, but the upper reaches of the scene remain out of frame."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_4778.jpeg" alt="Tilted upward even more, the view now encompasses a sweeping, early-morning skyline through the tall glass panes. The brightening horizon glows with rich gold and pale orange hues, silhouetting a layer of low clouds that drift above a broad expanse of water in the distance. Centered in the foreground, the tall clay pot supports a slender, branching plant—its silvery-green leaves fanning out against the skyline, accentuating the interplay of interior and exterior. Below, the city’s towers and rooftops stretch toward the lake, their windows catching the soft dawn light. A flicker of neon signage glows on one building, while another stands crowned by a recognizable red hotel name. The wooden bench with its golden dragon and teapot remains at the bottom edge, gently anchored by the subdued light. The entire scene merges the quiet stillness of the interior with the vast, awakening cityscape and lake beyond."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

"I think, therefore I am." My mistake! I've been identifying with thought, and unconsciously developed this belief: "It is only through thinking that I am." And, further, "If I leave thought behind I leave a necessary part of myself behind and the part of me that goes on is lost because it is only through thought that I know that I am."

Whoops.

Thank you, Ken.

It was in his care and by his words that this was given me:

"Do you get the sense that you have a body, or that you _are_ a body?"

_Ummm I'd use a less possessive verb because my body feels like an honored component and not something that I just straight up_ have\*, but between the two, it's more that I am operating in tandem with a body. I don't feel like I\* am _my body._

"What if you're not your mind, either?"

_... ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh_

The essence of a thing is always alive. More alive even than its form. :) Much of the time, the form of a thing can change to suit the shifting and evolving expression of its essence. This is fun and good. :)

If a form is perceived by an observer without also perceiving and associating its essence, ... well, anything can always happen, so who knows, you know? But there is a mechanical distinction there: missing the forest for the trees, one might start chopping down trees without considering what it might mean for the forest. Or, even before that, one might feel completely lost among the trees without the possibility of feeling _held and cared for_ by the forest in whose care one now unknowingly rests. Or doesn't rest, maybe.

If a population of observers largely and broadly forgets about the essence channeled by a given form, a time comes when the form becomes most useful as something to push _against_. This is a popular fate for religion. Here in the west, we had a minute there when that's how we thought about marriage. Not all of us, but many of us. Marriage _can_ be a portal to Happily Ever After, but only when that form _serves_ the essence. Lose the essence, and marriage becomes most useful as something to push against.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_4782.jpeg" alt="A tighter, closer perspective reveals the morning sun just as it crests the horizon, shining through a faint layer of early light. Unlike the earlier wide-angle shots, this image is captured with a more focused lens, drawing us in to peer through the elliptical leaves and slender trunk of the same potted tree from before. Its narrow branches are silhouetted in the foreground, forming a dark lattice against the warm, golden glow of the rising sun. Gentle lens flare—an almost pinkish orb—floats near the sun’s reflection on the windowpane, which itself shows subtle smudges and streaks from within. The silhouetted tops of a few distant buildings, barely visible below, hint at the urban surroundings outside. In this more intimate framing, the sun’s radiance and the delicate interplay of leaves and light become the central focal point, capturing the moment of dawn’s arrival through the tree’s natural screen."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I've found that I _can_ look straight at the sun, and that when I do so the haze and glare and halo of it all vanish, and it becomes as easy as looking at a full moon.

I've found that I don't enjoy this quite as much as beholding the sun in motion. :)

So sometimes I'll look straight at it, let it resolve, give it a wink, and then let my gaze move on, inviting the haze and the glare and the halo back into my vision, enjoying the dance and play of light again.

I've spent thirty years investing in thought. On or about my 36th birthday, I sort of ... completed it? Solved it? I'm not sure what this will look like in retrospect, because it's not as if thought and thinking won't be useful and _wonderful_ in the future. But thought was my chief source of solace and reprieve and soothing, in all that time, and when I reached a place where _thought could not continue_, I think I defaulted to the terror that it was first useful for addressing.

In the course of all that thinking, my awareness developed, and when thought stopped, my awareness went on. This was clear to me at the time (which is why I'm still here, _formed_), but it was no less terrifying.

Thank you, Ken. And Matt. And Abe. And Ian. And Andy. And Avi. And Abbey. And Mom and Dad. And _Isaac_. And ... everyone. Everyone, everyone, every one.

I was identifying with my mind. Suuuuuuper identified with my mind. And when my mind _popped_, I couldn't locate myself. Depersonalization. (This experience may have been underscored by cannabis withdrawal, lol. I've been hitting that stuff hard for a couple months, and I _stopped_ \~two weeks ago.)

I love my mind. I love my body. And I can go places that neither of them were made to go. _And I can bring them with me._ By and only by their consent, of course, but the point is, a single form can only lead one so far. At some point, any single form reaches its natural limit. I reached the natural limit of my mind-form, built a rocket made of thought and reached escape velocity, found myself drifting in the void beyond thought. Natural to panic. Natural to reach out to a friend. Natural for a friend to be with me, to listen, to lovingly observe, to support. Natural for a friend to see something that I could not, and natural for them to offer it in case I might find it helpful. Natural for something found by a loving friend to be found helpful. Natural to be helped. Natural to experience the help, and natural to return by newly-lit paths to a good-feeling place. Natural to feel good, as a baseline for being. Natural to be well.

Thank you, everyone.

I could not be here without you.
