I think my deal is the art and science of language-medicine.

For any given state of language, there is a path to any other given state of language.

All we experience is story.

Story is a stream of language.

We exist at the nexus of _so. many. stories._ But the plurality of story is useful only to the extent that it's useful. It's also useful — and valid! — to treat it all as one story with a variety of \~complementary plotlines.

A story that feels stuck — that's _probably_ a nearly universal experience.

All we gotta do is adjust the story-telling from here, yeah? Run a drain-snake through the pipes? Demonstrate the viability of a theoretical agent that can navigate all pipes _eventually_, thus rendering temporary and thereby ultimately illusory (though possibly also necessary) the clogs themselves? And what is a story-clog but a collection of agents who are resisting cooperation, anyway?

World peace was only ever going to work in the eyes of any given observer with an aggregate state transition that's reducible to a shrug and a grin and a _shall-we-get-on-with-it?_, right? The observer has to survive the entire transition — which _really_ narrows down our options for strategy. :)
