I've been waking up excited. :)

Keep your eye on the ball.

This being the future we're talking about, and given that the future that arrives always does so _out of the corner of your eye_, ... this suggests something specific about vision.

Your vision is not an needle threading its way through to the future you imagine.

Your vision is a scalpel.

Nope. Not a scalpel. A... wait, maybe it _is_ a needle? But a wet needle? Like a needle with a hole through it, passing... passing _yourself_ into what you perceive? And the cost of using that needle from the first-person perspective is that you can't actually see how your payload is landing in the destination? You can just kinda _aim_, and ... let what happens next _happen_?

I was aiming for a construction that would give intuitive reason to the idea of using your vision as a channel-clearer, like the prow of a boat, suggesting that _propellant_ is not really useful unless you are also aiming into _and cutting_ the resistence...

And, truly, I had a vision of [a three-body grid diagram](https://www.ooo.fun/1/1), in which the observer is aware of the effect of their focus, and so they use it like an active tool, shaping the terrain of the Knowable so as to provide a graceful, resistance-free path for the incoming Unknown, so that _when the Unknown arrives_ it does so with a velocity vector that is _useful_ — like a well-designed water feature, be it water slide or faucet.

You see what I'm saying, I think.

That sentence just above is incredibly deliberate.

"We forge the chains we wear in life" okay yeah but you know how something poorly built (or worn) will just fall apart (off) if you look at it funny? Also, do you know how useful chains are? Okay fine, humans _extrude chains_ as a function of their daily operation, sure. _Re-purpose your chains bro_

I named [the Wizard of Oz future](03/) to integrate its inertia fully into my now. If I held it in my awareness but prevented it from integrating, it would _condense_ into something that I would eventually experience _with my body_ instead of just with my mind. I would prefer to not put my body through that. So, calmly and lightly, I name the horrible (eh) thing, and afford us both (it and me) the opportunity to become something new together — something born from the earth we share, and not from the aether I imagine. Choose your realm! You've got an ND (NP?) printer in both places. :)
