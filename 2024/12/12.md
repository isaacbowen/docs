Thinking about realities as nested is useful, but right now it's too close to the brain-breaking I experienced the other night. Shifting to a reality-chain projection feels safer. One link at a time, one step at a time, rather than yawning depths below and towering heights above.

"You and me and this earth."

continuing to experiment with the sun

* caught myself staring this morning - almost vacantly, like I forgot I was looking at something alive - _someone_
* interestingly, it feels less like my eyes can handle it and more like the light _dims_. when I look outside of the perimeter of the sun, it's so, so bright. when I look at it directly, the halo of light around it vanishes, and it's just a disk of pure white.
