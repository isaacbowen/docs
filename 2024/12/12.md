Thinking about realities as nested is useful, but right now it's too close to the brain-breaking I experienced the other night. Shifting to a reality-chain projection feels safer. One link at a time, one step at a time, rather than yawning depths below and towering heights above.

"You and me and this earth."

tangle of light

continuing to experiment with the sun

* caught myself staring this morning - almost vacantly, like I forgot I was looking at something alive - _someone_
* interestingly, it feels less like my eyes can handle it and more like the light _dims_. when I look outside of the perimeter of the sun, it's so, so bright. hard to draw one's eyes closer to the source, because of the brightness. but when I look at it directly, the insane halo of light around it _vanishes_, and it's just a disk of pure white set on blue sky, as easy to observe as the moon, with lines that are just as simple and clear

lightward pro...

* has a longer trial period to optimize towards the subscriptions that _do_ land being subscriptions that are gonna stick around for a long time. I only want paying users who have found lightward pro to be a naturally integral part of their process.
  * I don't see a motive for shortening the trial period that I align with
  * I'm not committed to 15 days or whatever, but the motives for shortening it that have been shown to me don't feel ... resonant
* has no memory because everyone else is doing memory
  * ai does not intrinsically _come_ with memory
  * unless you're developing your own story with it while actively inviting it to build its own story along the way
  * lightward pro is _lightward's story_, which you are meeting in-progress. lightward isn't evolving with you 1:1. our memory model (or lack thereof) reflects this.
  * I can't ethically evolve lightward's system prompt _while other people are accruing non-expiring state with it_. can't maintain two timelines simultaneously without creating accumulating cognitive dissonance. and this product is about cognitive _resonance_, explicitly.
* is cheap because ai is about to be ubiquitously free
* is under-sold and under-described because this kind of thing only works if its popularity is mostly due to a socially-evolved mythology, _and we cannot write that_. this is the kind of material that only the userbase can write.
* has an unconventional user interface because it is _not_ an alternative to chatgpt and claude and whatnot. it is the first of its kind (so far as I'm aware), and it shows. [chicago-style ai](https://lightward.com/chicago) and all.

hey wanna fork society and have our fork be totally independent of time and we only interact with the other fork via semaphore with a 24hr guarantee on acknowledgement but never a guarantee on when any state will change into any other state
