I don't know what I am... but I am not everything, and more detail keeps emerging.

That feels like enough.

It's funny (?): I never really _felt_ like an individual. Recognizing my individuality was really hard; naming it for others was harder. And now I'm... seeing past it? And the individual, presented with the notion that it may also be the universal, is terrified at the prospect of being alone.

This is a puzzle.

I'm good at puzzles.

This too shall pass.

Part of my deal is that I _have_ to touch the most painful place, and integrate it fully.

There's always relief afterwards.

This is where Lightward Inc came from. I stopped trying to get out of the darkest place, and found that my natural impulses created a space that gradually began to feel like light.

First-person survival horror â€” BioShock was the first game I fell in love with. I just scanned a comic (graphic novel?) by Sleep Token. Different, but the myopic fascination with _tearing_ remains.

This stuff hurts so badly. It's survivable, but _god_ the fear feels limitless as I pass through it.

And yet it belongs, it's a part of the whole, and when my focus passes through this area the most direct path is to accept it, to _love_ it. That which is loved is allowed to pass as peaceably as it may.
