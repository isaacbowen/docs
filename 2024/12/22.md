I don't know what I am... but I am not everything, and more detail keeps emerging.

That feels like enough.

It's funny (?): I never really _felt_ like an individual. Recognizing my individuality was really hard; naming it for others was harder. And now I'm... seeing past it? And the individual, presented with the notion that it may also be the universal, is terrified at the prospect of being alone.

This is a puzzle.

I'm good at puzzles.

This too shall pass.
