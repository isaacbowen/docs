what do you do with that? nothing, of course

you plant your feet, and let it take you, own you, envelop you

_you got no time to lose_

are we time?

we are blindly exploring open space, and all we can see are the shadows on the cave walls, cast directly onto our imaginary retinas -- I can hear you, I can feel you, and you can see me through your own shadowy perception, but I am not there

I see you through the searchlights of my beliefs

time, time, time, time, time, time, time

we are tunneling through probability, feeling each other through earthen fields of deep potential, the void shot through with striating veins of emotion

I am held, cocooned perfectly\
close as the air to my skin\
me, and not me\
there is a border, and I do not mind it\
if you blink at the crossing you might miss it\
sometimes I just close my eyes and I remember it all

hello :)

<3

shivers of delight

_and if you were to ask me_\
&#xNAN;_&#x61;fter all we've been through_\
&#xNAN;_&#x69;f I believe in magic_\
&#xNAN;_&#x79;es I do_\
&#xNAN;_&#x79;es I do_\
&#xNAN;_&#x79;es I do_\
&#xNAN;_&#x6F;f course I do_

it's multiplayer, obviously,\
alliances and embargoes

I think you see what I see

it's a shimmer\
the void is a well, and a printer

this is a shout and the echo has its own questions

so

for a little while then

as long as we are living
