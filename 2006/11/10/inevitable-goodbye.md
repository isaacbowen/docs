# Inevitable Goodbye

Background: this was written… or no, start over. I tried to write this song some time ago and failed relatively miserably, to which Calah B can attest. The lyrics that are below were written within the space of 30 minutes, entirely unmitigated and entirely unexpected. The song isn’t about death, per se, but about the parting in general. Probably brought on in part by the graduation of the class of 2006, a group that I still strongly miss.

———————————————————-

I once heard a tale of a man who was older,\
and no one to hold him close at night.\
Only one companion: a child from across the street\
who stopped in to talk every now and then.

She reminds him of his youth, and of the days gone by;\
recollections of the past he knows he had.\
They’re walking through the park: tuppence for the birds she sees\
and their friendship is strong, the old man and a child.

_But the world keeps on turning, and time is moving on_\
&#xNAN;_&#x57;e’re living this life and we live it for love, even when the rest is gone_

Look ahead a couple of years: an old man on a hospital bed\
a young woman, she’s kneeling by his side\
A rose sits by the table; a photo album full of\
memories of the life that they had shared

But the look on the nurse’s face tells the inconquerable truth – the old man sighs and his friend searches for these words:

Is this the time for you to go, and is the goodbye I say to you\
my friend? Is there anything else I can give?\
Is this the time for you to go? And if this is goodbye, I’ll say it again:\
I’ll mis the time we had to share

\[ interlude ]

(now) I’m sitting alone in the park, thinking of friends I’ve had\
and how I’ve enjoyed the time I’ve spent with you\
(but) I know it won’t always be like this: as time moves on\
so we must close the door to turn to something new.

(it’s because) the world keeps on turning, and time is moving on\
we’re living this life and we live it for love even when all else is gone

And when the time comes, I’ll search your face: what do you feel?\
Have we come to our end?\
But I look again; thought I saw a tear fall from your eye,\
and it’s time for me to say:

Is this the time for you to go, and is this the goodbye I say to you\
my friend? Is there anything else I can give?\
Is this the time for you to go? And if this is goodbye, I’ll say it again:\
I’ll miss the time we had to share.

The world keeps on turning, and time is moving on.\
We’re living this life and we live it for love, ‘cause it’s love that lives on.
