# College

I’m ~~concerned~~ ~~worried~~ ~~freaking~~ rather nervous about MIT. My application was deferred, like 90% of them, and I’ll find out in March if I’m among the 10% of the deferred that are accepted.

Statistically, the odds are somewhat against me. My test scores generally fit in to the upper-mid-range of the middle 50% accepted (well, excepting my SAT Math Reasoning score, which was abysmal. Oddly, the SAT Subject Math II test score was far better), but they’re nothing stellar against MIT’s norm…

Meh. I just want to find _out_, one way or another. If I’m in, I’m in, and I’ll be in Massachusetts this time next year. (Actually not; it’ll be Christmas break still.) If I’m not, I’ll either be at Madison, Northwestern College, or Illinois Tech. Or hey – I could always go to Nicolet. :) Though… I truly think that MIT is my best match. (Albeit it’s whether I’m the best match for MIT that matters.) It’s a higher-level technically-inclined school that also puts emphasis on the right half of the brain – _creative_ intellect. Which is what _I’m_ about, and not many schools of MIT’s caliber work hard at achieving that balance.

Geeeahhh. I’m generally able to put aside worry. The promise that ‘all things work together for good for those who love God according to his purpose’ is something that I hold to tightly, and I suppose it applies in my post-secondary education as well… Kinda bothers me that I can’t get myself past worry here in this relatively inconsequential item. I mean, yes, it does matter which college I end up going to, but one way or another, I think I will end up at a decent institution.

But, what happens happens, and the world won’t end come March. Then again, maybe it will, and the whole thing will be moot. You never know.

Washington & Lee has kindly reminded me that “it’s not too late too apply!” Bah. Colleges that spam don’t rank very high on my list. If a college needs to resort to spam to find applicants, then is it really any good?

Anyway. The day has come and gone, and just now it’s 9:30 pm. Ethan and Mom are still in Marshfield (though Ethan is likely to be released tomorrow-ish), and mostly everyone else is in the parlor watching Pride and Prejudice. Really an excellent film. Nothing terribly interesting on Facebook… Hm. I think I’m done here.

Enjoy the evening, should you read this yet today. Cheers.
