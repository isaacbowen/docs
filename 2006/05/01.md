## Prom and things

Ben and I weren’t intending to go to Prom; we were just going to go bowling for an hour or so and then head to post-Prom at the Cinema. The Prom advisor, however, gave me two tickets for helping the Court out with their intro audio, so… off we went. Both wearing suitcoats and shades, no less.

Prom wasn’t bad. Quite definitely better than Snoball, but there you are. :) The DJ, as Matt put it, “had his good times and his bad times.” He played the [hampster dance](http://hampsterdance.com) right before the end (a good move), but played the Barbi song (“I’m a Barbi girl…”) directly afterwards. Which is why we left. :D The only restaurant open at 11:45 pm is Taco Bell, I believe.

So… Got home at 2:45am-ish, having Sunday School and such (later) this morning. A kid at SS had just been to two subsequent sleepovers, resulting in about 4 hours of sleep against the past 44 hours of consciousness (-ish). Poor guy… he broke down right in the middle of the lesson. Ee.

Slept for 4-5 hours this afternoon, then helped Dad out with a patch job at greenhouse 4. The pressure from the inflated plastic walls raised up the wooden rails on either side, leaving a gap underneath that needed filling.

And _now_ I just found out that I exceeded my alloted 6 automated transactions with my bank account and have had a few services disabled until the end of the month (today, incidentally), in addition to the charge of a $20 fine. Geeah. Who knew…
