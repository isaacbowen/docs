# I wonder if story-telling is the soul making a backup.

This occurred to me yesterday when I found myself telling someone new the same stories that I’ve told every other someone-new in recent memory. This is perhaps just me choosing the same well-worn introductory tracks as a time-saver, here’s who I am in a hundred words or less, but that’s a non-starter if I’d rather talk about how I’m pretty sure none of us are only ourselves. So!

I posit that we are, more truly than we normally sense or experience, a network, and that _love_ is another word for _flow_ within that network. Also that the story-telling instinct exists to spread around the only things we truly have ourselves — our particular time- and context-bound experiences, and the impressions they’ve made on us. So that, when we as individuals are gone, we _as deltas_ will live on.

Abe’s dad is here for the weekend. He’s actually the “someone new” that I mentioned earlier; I went with that descriptor seeing as how yesterday was the first time that he and I had any meaningful amount of time together. The guy’s incredible. Or (and? because?), he gets out of the way of Jesus. I’m sitting here typing and looking at a pad of notes that I was jotting down during our conversation — all variations on a theme, that it’s just God, and us, and freedom in love. _For there is now no condemnation._ We are all created different, with different flaws — yet God wants to have a relationship with us all. And _can._ (And that’s the proof, I think. Love wins, across every single combination of flaws and faults, _because_ love is the act of connecting _without regard_ to flaws and faults. It can do nothing _but_ win.)

Anyway though, Rudy gets it. “We may not understand each other,” he said, “we may not be the same … ‘_but hello!’_”. Hello, my friend, hello person that I don’t understand or agree with. _Hello, how are you?_

Here’s a thing he’s realized in this last decade: “Jesus created me, _for this moment_. And the more in tune I am to Jesus, the more peace I have _but als&#x6F;_&#x74;he more I fit in to His plan. \[…] Acknowledge His love, and that His love has us _here_.”

And that’s not a thing I’d registered before, in those terms. There’s almost an urgency to it. If you assume the perspective that your particular combination of flaws and faults has _significant potential_ in the presence of love, and further that love is omnipresent, then _every moment_ becomes manifestly purposeful. You are here, unavoidably; from there, you can be merely yourself, or you can choose love, and be _the network_. The family, the village, the love, the kingdom, I don’t know what word to use here. In love, in connection, there is more than just _me._ Thankfully.

If story-telling is making backups, it’s a sign that we’re subconsciously, fundamentally, oriented upward, into the larger stream, which I think is all we ever were.

Onward and upward.
