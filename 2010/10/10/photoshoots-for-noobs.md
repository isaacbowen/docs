# Photoshoots for noobs

This past week, I had the pleasure of spending a few hours photographing my good friend Brittany Collins (fiancÃ©e of [Anthony Hook](http://anthonyrhook.com/), the lucky stiff). Partly a chance for her to get a few decent photos taken, partly for me to put [a new camera](http://imaging.nikon.com/products/imaging/lineup/digitalcamera/slr/d3100/spec.htm) through its paces, we headed out to Superior's [Wisconsin Point](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=wisconsin+point+superior\&gl=us\&ei=sf2vTOuuMY7GM4WHtaoK\&sll=46.699662,-92.001579\&sspn=0.000000,0.000000\&ie=UTF8\&hl=en\&view=map\&geocode=FY6UyAId1SqE-g\&split=0\&iwloc=A\&ved=0CBMQpQY\&sa=X).

I generally stick to environmental photography, and thus I'd never really done a formal photoshoot. I hastily scratched out a list of shots I wanted to get and the locations to get them in, but with no real experience in directing live subjects, I wasn't completely sure what to expect. Or what to _do_, really.

Things I learned, as an amateur:

* **Keep it loose.** Formality is boring. Natural movement and posturing is everything, so give your subject enough room to be comfortable within the bounds of your direction.
* **Tell me a story.** The best candid portraits happen when the subject is completely ignoring you, and has their mind on something totally different. (Surprise.) The most effective method I found for this was to have Brittany tell me a story, something notable from last week, or even a scene from The Office. Or several scenes from The Office.
* **Let me tell&#x20;**_**you**_**&#x20;a story.** You've just ducked around the corner, and you're hiding from someone - try to see if you're being followed, without being seen. Alternatively, you're a professional model who takes herself far too seriously.
* **Plan for colors.** We nailed this one, actually. Bring changes of clothing with a range of colors and patterns, bearing in mind the general location you'll be shooting in. I say "general", because it's important to --
* **Explore.** The only place I had planned for was one stretch of beach. And the lighthouse. And we didn't even do the lighthouse.
* **Use the environment.** People don't go out by old barns and pose next to classic cars of their own impetus. Someone might be expected play in the sand on the beach, though.
* **Shoot in RAW.** Do it. Even if Lightroom [doesn't yet have native support for your camera's implementation](http://forums.adobe.com/message/3165900). >\_>

The full photoset is [here, on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/isaacbowen/sets/72157625117549324), and is roughly 2/3 complete. Turns out, I spend a lot of time in post.
