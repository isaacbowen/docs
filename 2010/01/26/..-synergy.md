So, turns out that I pretty much don't have any idea what the hell I'm talking about. I have some vague, half-formed idea, but nothing concise and exact, and this is probably why it feels like my head is unraveling a little.

No context in particular for this. Generally applicable. When I speak with you the reader and trip over my words more than usual, know that any words that do manage to follow each other in some logical order are most likely the result of instinctual bs-ing. Feel free to count them as such.

meh. I just want to be able to communicate. Speaking your mind is hard when you don't know what your mind is doing.
