# sometimes goodbye is a second chance

Fuck, I don't know.

Withdrawal from my old school is in, everything is sort of tentatively paid for, car and all. The paychecks (er, Paypal receipts) aren't coming in as regularly as I'd hoped for, but with any luck at all the sublet will be a success and I'll save seven hundred a month.

Pissed off without a really good reason to be. A lot of nights are like this.

Haxxored the Wii, which has proven to be really useful. Turns out, full games can be saved to an sd card (or some sort of usb storage media), in addition to the usually touted benefits of playing burned discs and torrenting WiiWare titles. (One would only do such things to provide backups for one's own legally purchased games, obviously.) Other bonuses: MPlayer, an ftp server, and .. that's all I've really messed with. And a savegame extracter/importer, for when Super Mario's restrictions get in the way.

Not sure yet if I miss Chicago. Or how that works. Transitioning is something that's historically come with relative ease. (Not counting preliminary second-guessing, which sucks.) City to city, it is what it is and there isn't a whole lot of difficulty with that, after it's done. Taking it as a good sign that it's not bothering me that I left. Though I haven't really kept in contact with anyone, since then. Only been a couple weeks, but.. meh. There were a handful of really important relationships there. I don't know if it was ever communicated, how much they actually meant. Though it's not like it's too late.

The timezone on Wordpress is off again, noticing this as the draft saves itself. "Draft Saved at 1:23:53 am."

Work to do tomorrow. This generally has had little to do with whether or not work actually gets done, but one can hope.
