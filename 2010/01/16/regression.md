# regression

I've been told I need to write more. I don't think this sort of thing was the idea, right, but all things in time...

my dorm room workspace. the flag is integral, as the desk light is more than a little abrasive.

Falling asleep as I write this. Day three on campus was much like day two, except in that there was Little Caesars rather than Jimmy John's for the mealoftheday. The campus welcome week activities seem to be largely geared toward freshmen, and apart from one last night (my involvement was limited to a two hour group conversation with existing students, was worth it), my time has instead been mostly spent on work. (Per usual, I know.) Classes start on Tuesday, thus I've self-imposed a Monday night deadline for the contract at hand.

The photo above is, as captioned, a view of my desk. I'm in a double-occupancy dorm room, first time since early freshman year. Which is fine, not a big deal. Nice to not have to deal with rent/utility contracts. (As an aside, the subletter (subleasee?) moved into my Chicago apartment on Wednesday. Horray.) Whitebox was up here initially, along with the monitor, but has since moved down to Anthony's room, one floor down. The space there is better suited for the thing.

1:42am. ... Having a roommate may actually force me back into a somewhat normal sleep schedule, come to think of it.
