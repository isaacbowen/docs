# Gatekeeper

In a lot of ways, this is where Lightward started.

Gatekeeper was a Shopify app -- an early one, created shortly after Shopify opened their app platform.

It's not running anymore; it was replaced by Locksmith. Gatekeeper was created even before Shopify had a customer model, and when the customer model _did_ appear it made more sense to architect something completely new.
